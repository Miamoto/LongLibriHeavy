WERE BECOMING MORE GREEK THE LANDS OF ASIA MINOR WERE LOSING THEIR GREEK POPULATION AND PASSING INTO THE HANDS OF MEN OF EASTERN RACE FROM SYRIA ARMENIA AND PERSIA ONE BENEFICIAL RESULT OF THE SLAVONIC SETTLEMENTS IN THE BALKAN DISTRICT WAS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SERFDOM IN THE EMPIRE THE PLACE OF THE SERF BEING TAKEN BY FREE TENANTS OR VILLAGE COMMUNES 133 134 THE DAWN OF MEDIEVAL EUROPE IN THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS OF THE TIME IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT LITERATURE AND ART SHOULD HAVE DECAYED AND VARIOUS FOOLISH SUPERSTITIONS GROWN UP THEOLOGY HAD FILLED THE EAST WITH CONTROVERSY BUT RELIGION WAS AT A LOW EBB AND THE MORAL STANDARD OF THE CLERGY WAS THOROUGHLY UNSATISFACTORY THE TASK THAT LAY BEFORE A REFORMING EMPEROR WAS SUFFICIENTLY DISCOURAGING SIEGE OF BUT NO REFORM COULD BEGIN TILL THE GREAT STRUGGLE WITH UOPIE 718 THE MOSLEMS THE IMPENDING OUTBREAK OF WHICH HAD CALLED LEO TO THE THRONE WAS OVER WITHIN FIVE MONTHS OF THE ACCESSION OF THE NEW EMPEROR THE SARACEN COMMANDER

THAT WAS POURED FROM CAULDRONS OR VOMITED FROM TUBES ON TO THE SHIPS OR ENGINES OF THE ENEMY IT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN FIRST USED IN THE SIEGE OF CONSTANTI NOPLE OF 73 AND THE FOLLOWING YEARS LEO S FIRST SUCCESS WAS THE BURNING OF TWENTY TRANS PORTS WITH THIS GREEK FIRE AN EXPLOIT THAT FILLED THE ENEMY WITH FEAR OF THIS DEADLY WEAPON OF DEFENCE IN THE LONG ARID SEVERE WINTER THAT FOLLOWED THE BESIEGERS SUFFERED GREAT HARDSHIPS BUT IN THE SPRING FRESH REIN FORCEMENTS ARRIVED ILL FORTUNE DOGGED THE SARACEN CAUSE A LARGE NUMBER OF EGYPTIAN CHRISTIANS WHO 136 THE DAWN OF MEDIAEVAL EUROPE WERE SERVING IN THE MOSLEM FLEET DESERTED TO THE ENEMY AND EMBOLDENED BY THIS LEO MADE ANOTHER ATTACK ON THE SHIPS SOME OF WHICH HE DESTROYED AND THREW THE REST INTO CONFUSION THEN A SARACEN ARMY THAT WAS BLOCKAD ING THE ASIATIC SHORES OF THE BOSPHORUS WAS SURPRISED AND ROUTED BY A BODY OF EOMAN SOLDIERS FAMINE ALSO BEGAN TO THREATEN THE BESIEGING ARMY AND FINALLY IN THE SUMMER OF 718 A BULGARIAN ARMY FROM THE NORTH FELL UPON THE SARACENS AND INFLICTED SEVERE LOSSES ON THEM ON THE 15TH OF AUGUST THE SIEGE WAS RAISED AND THE MOSLEM RETREAT BEGAN THE ARMY SUCCEEDED IN REACHING SYRIA BUT THE FLEET WAS SCATTERED BY A TEMPEST AND ONLY FIVE VESSELS ARRIVED HOME OF ALL THE GREAT ARMADA THAT WAS TO OPEN THE GATE OF EUROPE TO THE MOSLEMS ARAB RECORDS PUT THE LOSS ON THE SARACEN SIDE AT NOT LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MEN THE DEFENCE OF CONSTANTINOPLE BY LEO DESERVES TO RANK WITH THE BATTLE FOUGHT BY CHARLES MARTEL FOURTEEN YEARS LATER THEY REPRESENT THE TWO SUPREME ATTEMPTS MADE BY THE OMMEYAD DYNASTY TO BREAK THROUGH THE GREAT BARRIERS THAT GUARDED CHRISTENDOM FROM MOSLEM ATTACK FROM THIS TIME THE TIDE OF BATTLE TURNED AND THE REST OF THE CENTURY SAW THE GRADUAL DECLINE OF SARACEN RULE BOTH IN THE EAST AND IN THE WEST IN 750 THE LAST CALIPH OF THE OMMEYAD DYNASTY WAS SLAIN AND DAMASCUS FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE NEW DYNASTY OF THE ABBASIDES ONLY IN SPAIN DID THE OMMEYAD PARTY RETAIN POWER AND THE MOSLEMS OF THE WEST WERE HENCEFORTH CUT OFF FROM ALL CONNECTION WITH THOSE OF THE EAST ICONO THE DELIVERANCE OF CONSTANTINOPLE WAS IMMEDIATELY EDKT C 726 FOLLOWED BY THE OUTBREAK OF THE ICONOCLASTIC CONTROVERSY THE ICONOCLASTIC EMPERORS 137 PHIS GREAT CONTEST WHICH WAS DESTINED TO CAUSE THE FINAL EVERANCE BETWEEN EASTERN AND WESTERN EUROPE AND O PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A WESTERN EMPIRE WAS THE OUTCOME OF AN EDICT ISSUED BY LEO IN 26 ORDERING THE REMOVAL OF PICTURES AND IMAGES FROM THE HURCHES IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT LEO WAS MOVED TO THIS TEP BY THE JEERS OF THE MOSLEMS WHO CHARGED THE JHRISTIANS WITH IDOLATRY BUT HE WAS PROBABLY INFLUENCED IIITE AS MUCH BY THE GROWTH OF CHILDISH SUPERSTITIONS CON LECTED WITH THE PICTURES AND COLOURED FIGURES

SPIRIT ON THE ECCLESIASTICAL TENDENCIES OF THE TIME A KIND OF EIGHTH CENTURY LUTHERANISM MARIOLATRY THE WORSHIP OF SAINTS AND THE ADORATION OF RELICS WERE INCLUDED IN THE IMPERIAL CONDEMNATION UNDER CONSTANTINE V AND MON ASTICISM ITSELF WAS ATTACKED BY HIS REFORMING ZEAL THE CHIEF SUPPORT OF THE IMPERIAL POLICY CAME FROM THE ARMY WHICH WAS RECRUITED TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT FROM THE SAME DISTRICT

OUT OF THE REGION OF HISTORY AND ARE CHIEFLY INTERESTING TO THE STUDENTS OF MYTH AND FOLK LORE IS STILL A STORY FULL OF PICTURESQUE INCIDENT AND STRIKING HEROISM IT IS A STORY OF THE BANDING TOGETHER OF STURDY MOUNTAIN EERS IN THE DAYS WHEN SIMPLE COUNTRY FOLK WERE HELD OF LITTLE ACCOUNT WHO STRONG IN THEIR LONGING FOR FREE DOM AND IN THE LOVE OF THEIR MOUNTAIN HOME WERE ABLE TO OPPOSE SUCCESSFULLY KINGS NOBLES AND TRAINED ARMIES AND TO FORM AN INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS HELD ITS OWN DOWN TO THE PRESENT DAY IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THERE WAS NO SUCH COUNTRY AS SWITZERLAND THE LAND WE NOW KNOW UNDER THAT SWABIA NAME WAS THEN SIMPLY PART OF THE OLD DUCHY OF SWABIA LIKE THE REST OF GERMANY IT BELONGED TO THE EMPIRE AND WAS DIVIDED AMONGST VARIOUS FEUDAL LORDS HOLDING THEIR LANDS AS IMPERIAL FIEFS MONASTERIES WERE VERY IMPOR TANT IN SWABIA AND MUCH OF THE COUNTRY BELONGED TO THEM THOSE OF EINSIEDELN AND ST GALL BEING ESPECIALLY RENOWNED MANY OF THESE RELIGIOUS HOUSES HAD WHAT WERE KNOWN AS GRANTS OF IMMUNITY WHICH CONFERRED THE PRIVILEGE OF HOLDING DIRECTLY FROM THE EMPIRE NOT FROM 98 RISE OF THE SWISS REPUBLIC 99 ANY INTERMEDIATE LORD AND AN IMPERIAL BAILIFF WAS SENT TO SUPERVISE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WHICH WAS THEREFORE NEVER UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANY COUNT OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MANY GREAT NOBLES ALSO HAD TERRITORY IN THE MOUNTAIN LAND WHICH CENTRES ROUND THE LAKE OF LUCERNE AND THE UPPER VALLEYS OF THE EHINE AND THE RHONE SUCH AS THE COUNTS OF SAVOY OF GENEVA OF KIBURG OF RAPPERSWELL ABOVE ALL OF HABSBURG ON A THE HABS HILL CALLED THE WIILPELSBERG NOT FAR FROM THE TOWN OF BRUGG A MASSIVE TOWER STILL STANDS TO PERPETUATE THE MEMORY OF THE GREAT FAMILY WHO DWELT IN THEIR HABICHTS HURG OR HAWK S CASTLE IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE EMPIRE ITSELF CAME UNDER THEIR RULE IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING TO DISTINGUISH THIS ALPINE SOUTHERN REGION FROM ANY OTHER PART OF THE EMPIRE OR FROM ANY OTHER FEUDAL COUNTRY BUT IT VERY SOON BEGAN TO DEVELOP CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS OWN A LAND OF MOUNTAINS IS NEVER QUITE SO FEUDALISED NOR QUITE SO DEPENDENT AS A LAND OF PLAINS SERFDOM NEVER SEEMS TO TAKE SO DEEP A ROOT NATURE RENDERS IMPOSSIBLE THE SAME AMOUNT OF CONTROL AND SEIGNORIAL MANAGEMENT THIS PART OF SWABIA WAS EARLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE GROWTH OF COMMUNES BOTH IN TOWNS AND VILLAGES THE MEMBERS OF THESE AS SOCIATIONS WERE BOUND TOGETHER BY THE POSSESSION OF CERTAIN RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES AND OBTAINED TO A GREAT EXTENT THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR OWN AFFAIRS TOWN COMMUNITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES SPRANG UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND SOMETIMES THE SCATTERED INHABITANTS OF A MOUNTAIN VALLEY WOULD FORM THEMSELVES INTO A UNION OF THIS DESCRIPTION SOME SWABIAN TOWNS WERE FREE IM TOWUS PERIAL CITIES FROM THE FIRST DIRECTLY UNDER THE EMPEROR AND WITH THE RIGHT OF SENDING REPRESENTATIVES TO THE DIET OTHERS WERE BUILT ON THE LANDS OF CHURCHES OR 100 THE END OF THE MIDDLE AGE LORDS BUT WERE PRIVILEGED ALTHOUGH DEPENDENT AND OFTEN SHOOK OFF THEIR SUBJECTION LATER IN ANY CASE THEY WERE HOMES OF COMPARATIVE FREEDOM AND A YEAR AND A DAY IN A CHARTERED TOWN GAVE LIBERTY TO THE SERF WHO COULD ESCAPE THITHER IN SOUTHERN SWABIA THE LEADING TOWNS WERE ZURICH A FREE IMPERIAL CITY LUCERNE AT FIRST UNDER THE ABBEY OF MURBACH BUT LATER INDEPENDENT AND BERN WHICH OBTAINED IMPERIAL IMMUNITY ON THE EXTINCTION OF THE FAMILY OF ZARRINGEN BY WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY FOUNDED COUNTRY AS THE TOWNS W ERE PROTECTED AND RENDERED BOLD BY THEIR WALLS SO THE VALLEYS WERE GIVEN SECURITY AND IN DEPENDENCE BY THEIR MOUNTAINS THE INHABITANTS OF THESE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS GROUPED INTO COMMUNES WERE DRAWN CLOSELY TOGETHER BY COMMON INTERESTS BY PASTORAL AND AGRICULTURAL WORK AND BY POSSESSION OF RIGHTS OVER THE ALLMEND OR MARK AS THE WASTE LAND BETWEEN THE LITTLE SETTLEMENTS WAS CALLED AND FOR USE OF WHICH AS PASTURE THE WHOLE COMMUNE AS A RULE WOULD BE ASSOCIATED VALLEY COMMUNES BEGAN TO BE FORMED IN URI SCHWITZ UNTERWALDEN GLARUS AND OTHER DISTRICTS AND HTTLE BY LITTLE THE INHABITANTS SUCCEEDED IN WINNING RECOGNITION OF THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND OBTAINING CHARTERS OF PRIVILEGES THE NOBLES WERE NOT LIKELY TO LET THEIR AUTHORITY GO STRUGGLES WITHOUT A STRUGGLE THERE WERE VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO UOVIEF MAKE THE WHOLE DUCHY OF SWABIA INTO A UNITED PRINCI PALITY ONE GREAT FAMILY AFTER ANOTHER TRIED TO AMASS MORE AND MORE TERRITORY INTO ITS OWN HANDS BUT NONE TRIED HARDER NOR WITH MORE SUCCESS THAN THE HABSBURGS WHOSE INCREASING POWER THREATENED THE OVERTHROW OF THE FREE COMMUNES THE COMMUNES LOOKED TO THE EM PEROR FOR HELP AGAINST THE ARISTOCRACY URI WAS TAKEN UNDER IMPERIAL PROTECTION IN 1231 SCHWITZ WON ITS RISE OF THE SWISS EEPTJB IC 101 CHARTER OF IMMUNITY IN 1240 AND IN THE COMMON FEAR OF OPPRESSION TOWNS AND DISTRICTS BEGAN THE PRACTICE OF BANDING TOGETHER TO OBTAIN STRENGTH VARIOUS LEAGUES WERE FORMED FROM TIME TO TIME BERN UNITED WITH LUCERNE SCHWITZ WITH UNTERWALDEN AND URI AND THEN THE THREE OF THEM WITH LUCERNE AND ZURICH THESE WERE AT FIRST ONLY TEMPORARY LEAGUES BUT IN THIS LINKING OF TOWN AND COUNTRY FOR MUTUAL PROTECTION WE SEE THE TRUE BEGINNING OF THE LATER CONFEDERATION FROM 1254 TO 1273 WAS THE IMPERIAL INTERREGNUM WHEN AS CARLYLE SAYS THERE WAS NO KAISER NAY AS MANY AS THREE AT ONCE A PERIOD OF TERRIBLE CONFUSION AND PARTY STRIFE ASSUREDLY BUT NEVERTHELESS AN OPPOR TUNITY FOR STEADY ADVANCE TOWARDS FREEDOM WHILST THE OFREAT MEN OF THE LAND HAD LITTLE TIME TO ATTEND TO HUMBLE MATTERS IN THE END AS WE HAVE SEEN ELSEWHERE RU RUDOLF OF DOLF THE HEAD OF THE HABSBURGS BECAME KING OF GER MANY AND DUKE OF AUSTRIA AS WELL AS EMPEROR A VERY IMPORTANT PERSONAGE INDEED THERE WAS GREAT FEAR THAT THE WHOLE OF SOUTHERN SWABIA WOULD NOW COME UNDER HIS SWAY HE BOUGHT FRIBURG NEUFCHATEL GLARUS AND OTHER PLACES ESTABLISHED RIGHTS OVER LUCERNE AND SUR ROUNDED THE FOREST CANTONS OF URI SCHWITZ AND UNTER WALDEN WITH A CORDON OF HIS PRIVATE ESTATES"

WITH AN ANCIENT CASTLE WHOSE HOUSES ARE INTERSPERSED WITH TREES AND WHICH STANDS AT A LITTLE DIS TANCE FROM NERNI ON THE PROMONTORY WHICH BOUNDS A DEEP BAY SOME MILES IN EXTENT SO SOON AS WE ARRIVED

FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW A FEUDAL HOLDING FROM ANOTHER AN INDEPENDENT SCANDINAVIAN STATE THE CONTRADICTION IN NORMANDY S POSITION EXPLAINS MUCH OF ITS EARLY HISTORY THE NEW COLONY WAS SAVED FROM ABSORP

NEIGHBORS AT ONCE A PRANKISH COUNTY AND A DANISH COLONY IT SLOWLY FORMED ITSELF INTO THE SEMI INDEPENDENT DUCHY WHICH IS THE HIS TORIC NORMANDY OF THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH CENTURIES ALTHOUGH ROLLO WAS BAPTIZED IN 912 AND SIGNALIZED HIS CONVERSION BY EXTENSIVE GRANTS OF LAND TO THE GREAT CHURCHES AND MONASTERIES OF HIS NEW TERRITORIES HIS CHRISTIANITY SAT LIGHTLY UPON HIM AND LEFT HIM A NORSE SEA

CONSCIOUS AS HE MUST HAVE BEEN OF THE IMMENSE POWER THAT HE WIELDED AS THE PEOPLE S MAN IN AN INHARMONIOUS ADMINISTRATION IT IS GREATLY TO HIS CREDIT THAT HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO FORCE THE BAND OF OUR

GUSTO A SLASHING COMMEN TARY ON THE PRINCE S VERY SENSIBLE MEMORANDUM ON EASTERN AFFAIRS WHICH WAS FAR MORE CRITICAL THAN CANDID AND WHICH THE PRIME MINISTER SUBJECTED TO A VERY UN FAVOURABLE EXAMINATION POSSIBLY THE HOME SECRETARY FELT THAT WHEN EVERY CONCESSION ON THE PART OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE WAS FOLLOWED BY A FRESH MENACE ON THE PART OF BUSSIA WAR SOONER OR LATER WAS INEVITABLE AND THAT IT WAS UNNECES SARY TO DO MORE THAN RECORD THE FULFILMENT OF HIS VARIOUS PROPHECIES EVEN LORD ABERDEEN S BELIEF IN THE PACIFIC INTENTIONS OF THE EMPEROR WAS SHAKEN WHEN IN RETURN FOR OUR ADVICE

DISAPPROVED OF THE VAGUE LANGUAGE OF THE DOCUMENT WHICH WAS SO SIGNALLY TURNED TO GOOD ACCOUNT BY GOUNT NESSELRODE AND AGREED WITH LORD STRATFORD IN COUNTENANCING THE RIGHT OF THE SULTAN TO AMEND THE NOTE IN HIS FAVOUR IT WAS UNJUST HE CONTENDED LATER ON TO ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE A FORM OF WORDS ON TURKEY WHICH WE WERE NOT EQUALLY PREPARED TO IMPOSE ON BUSSIA THE CHIEF BLOT ON THE SYSTEM OF ACTION ADVOCATED BY LORD PALMERSTON WAS THAT IT WAS ADAPTED RATHER TO A QUESTION IN WHICH ENGLAND WAS ACTING SINGLE HANDED THAN TO ONE IN WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO PAY CON SIDERABLE DEFERENCE TO THE WISHES OF THE OTHER POWERS HE SEEMS TO HAVE PUT HIS TRUST ENTIRELY IN THAT ANGLO FRENCH ALLIANCE OF WHICH BY HIS APPROBATION OF THE COUP D ITAT HE HAD BEEN THECREATOR AND TO HAVE PAID SMALL REGARD TO THE MORAL SUPPORT OF AUSTRIA AND PRUSSIA IT IS TRUE THAT IN HIS PUBLIC UTTERANCES LORD PALMERSTON WISHING NO DOUBT TO PUT A STOP TO THE STORIES OF MINISTERIAL DIFFERENCES THAT WERE FLYING ABOUT LAID CON SIDERABLE STRESS UPON THE VALUE OF THE EUROPEAN CONCERT I BELIEVE HE SAID ON FEB 20TH 1854 I SHALL NOT OVERSTATE THE TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT THE CONDUCT OF ENG LAND AND FRANCE IN THAT RESPECT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY APPRECIATED BY AUSTRIA AND BY PRUSSIA WHEREAS IF MATTERS HAD BEEN HURRIED ON IN THE COURSE OF LAST SUMMER WHEN WE MIGHT HAVE HAD NO REASON OR RIGHT TO EXPECT THEIR CO OPERATION I CANNOT PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THE CONDUCT OF AUSTRIA AND PRUSSIA WOULD HAVE BEEN THO THE ABERDEEN MINI8TBY 16 SAME AS IT IS AT TBE PRESENT TIME BUT TKOUGH THE VOICE WAS THE VOICE OF PALMERSTON IHA ARGUMENTS WERE THE ARGUMENTS OF ABERDEEN AND THE HOME SECRETARY WAS MORE IN HIS ELEMENT WHEN HE PRPOEEDED TO DESCRIBE THE OBJECTS AT ISSUE ALL THE POWERS HE SAID HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE MOST SOLEMN AND DISTINCT MANNER THAT THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF THE TNRKISH EMPIRE IS AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE PEACE OF INROPE THAT IT IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THE BALANCE OF POWER AND THAT IT WONLD BE A CALAMITY TO ENROPE IF ANY ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DESTROY THAT INTEGRITY AND INDEPENDENCE WHY EVEN RUSSIA WHILE SHE IS PNRSNING THE COURSE WHICH IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL EXCEPT HER SELF TO BE FATAL TO THAT INDEPENDENCE EYEN RUSSIA DOES NOT YENTURE TO DENY THAT PRINCIPLE THAT THE INTEGRITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE TURKISH EMPIRE IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT AND CONDITION OF THE WELFARE OF EUROPE NOW SIR IT IS MANIFEST THAT IF RUSSIA WERE TO APPROPRIATE THESE TERRI TORIES NOW UNDER THE SWAY AND SOYEREIGNTY OF THE SULTAN SHE WOULD BECOME A POWER TOO GIGANTIC FOR THE SAFETY OF THE

NATURAL RE SOURCE AND WITH A POPULATION OF ENORMOUS EXTENT SHE WOULD BECOME DANGEROUS TO THE LIBERTIES OF EUROPE AND HER POWER WOULD BE FATAL TO THE INDEPENDENCE OF OTHER STATES I SAY THEREFORE IT IS

OBTAINED IN NUMEROUS OBSERVATIONS AVE MUST RECKON THE GAIN OF THE SEA AT A MEAN OF TAVO FEET PER CENTURY COMPUTING AT TEN THOUSAND YEARS THE TIME THAT HAS ELAPSED SINCE THE ICE SHEET OF THE LAST GLACIAL PERIOD PASSED FROM THESE SHORES THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THIS COAST EROSION SHOULD AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED FEET DURING A PERIOD OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS A VERY BRIEF AGE IN THE HISTORY OF THE

TWO TO THREE MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO THE RECESSION OF THE SHORE DUE TO THE ACTION OF THE WAVES MAY SAFELY BE ESTIMATED AT SEVERAL MILES TAKING ALL THE COASTLINE ON THE EASTERN BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES INTO CONSIDERATION WE SEE THAT THE SAND BEACHES OWING TO THEIR SINGULAR ENDURANCE OF WAVE ACTION A FEATURE I HAVE DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE HAVE AN IMPORTANT RESTRAINING EFIECT ON THE PROCESS OF MARINE EROSION MAKING AL LOWANCE FOR THIS PROTECTIVE WORK IT REMAINS CLEAR THAT THE EFFECT OF OCEAN WAVES IS TO WEAR BACK THE SHORELINES INTO THE LAND AND THIS AT A RATE WHICH IN A GEOLOGICAL SENSE MAY BE TERMED RAPID AS GEOLOGISTS FIND BUT FEW SHORES BORDERED B DISTINCT BENCHES CUT IN THE HARD ROCKS THE Y HAVE GENERALLY UNDERESTIMATED THE VALUE OF WAVE WORK BUT IN FORMING THEIR OPINION THEY HAVE NEGLECTED THE IMPORTANT FACT THAT THE CONTINENTS ARE CONTINUALLY CHANGING THEIR POSITIONS IN RELATION TO THE SEA LEVEL EVERY STEP IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM SHOWS THAT THE SHORE LANDS ARE CEASELESSLY AND AT TIMES SUDDENL MOVING UPWARD OR DOWNWARD EVEN THOSE COASTS WHICH NOW APPEAR TO BE STEADFAST HAVE IN VERY RECENT TIMES CHANGED THEIR POSITIONS BY SINKING OR RISING THE RESULT OF THESE PERPETUAL SWAYINGS OF THE COASTLINES IS TO DISTRIBUTE THE BENCHING ACTION OF THE WAVES OVER A WIDE ZONE EXTENDING ALONG THE MOST OF THE GREAT LANDS FROM A LEVEL MUCH BELOW THAT OF THE PRESENT SHORES TO A POSITION FAR HIGHER THAN THAT WHICH THEY NOW OCCUPY IN SOME INSTANCES WHERE THE SEA HAS CHANCED TO REMAIN FOR A LONG TIME IN CONTACT WITH THE LAND ON ONE HORIZONTAL PLANE WE NOTE THE EXISTENCE OF BROAD SHELVES OF ROCK EXTENDING OUTWARD FROM THE SEA CLIFFS SOMETIMES TO THE DISTANCE OF A MILE OR MORE THUS ON THE COAST OF YORKSHIRE FROM WHITBY SOUTHWARD A SEA CUT BENCH WITH ITS SURFACE JUST ABOVE LOW TIDE STRETCHES SEAWARD FROM THE FOOT OF THE TOWERING CLIFFS FOR AN AVERAGE DISTANCE OF MORE THAN A MILE ATTESTING IN THE J LAINEST POSSILDE MANNER THE CUTTING POWER OF THE SEA IN GENERAL WE MAY SAY OF THE EASTERN COASTS OF NORTH AMERICA THAT INDICATIONS OF MARINE AVORK ARE VISIBLE TO A HEIGHT OF SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE I LANE OF THE OCEAN AND THAT THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH CUTTING AVORK HAS BEEN DONE ON MUCH OF THE SLOPE AVHICH NOAV LIES BELOAV THE SEA HEN BY THE UPLIFTING OF THE LAND ANCIENT SEA BASES ARE CARRIED ABOVE THE LIMITS OF AVAVE ACTION THEY ARE QUICKLY AVORN AAVAY HY THE ROCE SSES OF EROSION AVHICH ARE PROPER TO THE LAND WHEN SUCH BENCHES ARE LOAVERED BENEATH THE OCEAN THEY ARE SOON COVERED B SEDIMENTS AND THUS BROUGHT INTO J OSITIONS AVHERE EVEN SUBSE 22 334 THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF SOIL EROSION QUENT UPRISING OF THE CONTINENT WOULD NOT CAUSE THEM TO BE RE VEALED ALONG THE EASTERN FACE OF NORTH AMERICA FROM SOUTH CAROLINA TO NEWFOUNDLAND THERE EXISTS A SERIES OF OLD MOUNTAIN RANGES TO WHICH WE MAY GIVE THE NAME OF THE LOST APPALACHIANS THAT HAVE BEEN WORN DOWN TO THEIR ROOTS BY SOME J ROCESS OF EROSION WEST OF THESE DEEPLY WASTED MOUNTAINS IN THE SECTION FROM PENN SYLVANIA SOUTHWARD WE HAVE THE YET OLDER RANGES OF THE BLUE RIDGE OR CENTRAL APPALACHIANS WHICH ON THEIR EASTERN FACE HAVE BEEN WORN AWAY THOUGH THEIR WESTERN PARTS RETAIN A CONSIDER ABLE RELIEF STILL FURTHER TO THE WEST BEHIND THE WALL OF THE MIDDLE APPALACHIANS LIE THE WEST APPALACHIANS OR CUMBERLAND AND ALLEGHANY RANGES THESE LAST NAMED ELEVATIONS RETAIN THEIR ORIGINAL RELIEFS MUCH MORE PERFECTLY THAN THE SEAWARD MOUN TAINS THEY ARE RELATIVELY LITTLE DEGRADED THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS MOUNTAINS IN COMMON SPEECH WHILE THOSE ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST THOUGH OF YOUNGER AGE HAVE LOST TO THE COMMON EYE THEIR MOUNTAINOUS CHARACTER AND ARE KNOWN TO THE GEOLOGIST ONLY BY THE ALTITUDES OF THEIR ROCKS CONSIDERING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ECONOMIC INTERESTS THE EROSION OR LAND DESTRUCTION WHICH IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE SEA WE NOTE THAT EVEN IN HISTORIC TIMES IT HAS WROUGHT CHANGES OF CONSIDERABLE MOMENT TO MANKIND WHEREVER THE SHORES ARE BORDERED BY VERY HARD ROCKS OR WALLED IN BY SAND BEACHES THE PROCESSES BY WHICH THE LAND IS STRI PED AWAY AND ITS DEBRIS CARRIED INTO THE SEA ARE SLOW THE DESTRUCTION IS DISTRIBUTED OVER A LONG ERIOD AND THERE IS NO DISTINCT EFFECT IN THE INTEREST OF MEN WHERE HOWEVER THE COASTS ARE OF SOFT ROCKS THE WASTE IS OFTEN SO RAPID THAT IT MAY DISPOSSESS COMMUNITIES OF THEIR IN HERITANCE THUS AT THE RATE OF MARINE INVASION WHICH IS NOW GOING ON ON THE SOUTHERN SHORES OF NANTUCKET THAT ISLAND IS LIKELY TO DISAPPEAR IN THE COURSE OF TWO OR THREE THOUSAND YEARS BEING IN THE END REDUCED TO THE CONDITION OF A SHOAL SUCH AS WE NOW FIND IN THE SHALLOWS WHICH STRETCH FAR TO THE SOUTHEASTWARD OF THAT ISLAND SHALLOWS WHICH SEEM TO MARK THE POSITION OF ANCIENT LANDS THAT HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE WAVES"

PRACTICABLE THE SADDLE HORSES IN COMMON USE BY THE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WERE SUF FICIENTLY WELL BRED FOR HUNTERS AND WERE IN FACT COMMONLY USED IN THE CHASE THERE WAS INDEED THAT DEGREE OF ATTACHMENT FOR

    "text": "9 A BATTLE WITH A KANGAROO HEN CAPTAIN COOK RETURNED FROM THE SOUTH SEAS AND DESCRIBED THE KANGAROO HIS ACCOUNT WAS RECEIVED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBT THAT AN ANIMAL AS LARGE AS A MAN SHOULD TRAVEL ONLY ON ITS HIND FEET BY MAKING WONDERFUL JUMPS AT SUCH A SPEED AS TO LEAVE THE SWIFTEST HORSE BEHIND WAS TOO MUCH TO BELIEVE UNTIL THE NATURALISTS REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS A FIELD MOUSE THE JERBOA IN EUROPE WHICH TRAVELED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE KANGAROO AND COULD GET OVER THE GROUND WITH GREAT RAPID ITY IT WAS THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THE CAPTAIN HAD SEEN AN ENORMOUS JERBOA AND MISTAKEN IT FOR A NEW VARIETY OF BEAST AND SO HE WAS ABSOLVED FROM THE CHARGE OF DOWNRIGHT FALSEHOOD THOUGH NOT FROM EXAGGERATION IN COURSE OF TIME THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS ASSERTION WAS ESTABLISHED A STUDY OF THE ANIMALS OF AUSTRALIA HAS SHOWN THAT THERE ARE NO FEWER THAN EIGHT S PECIES OF LARGE KAN GAROO AND SOME TWENTY AND MORE SMALLER KINDS IN ADDITION TO AN ASSORTED LOT OF HARE JERBOA 235 236 THE TAEKING HANDKERCHIEF AND RAT KANGAROOS ALL OF THEM GETTING ALONG IN THE WORLD BY MEANS OF THEIR HIND LEGS ONLY THE RED KANGAROO OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA IS THE LARGEST OF ALL THE LOT SPEEIMENS OF THIS EREATURE HAVE BEEN FOUND WEIGHING VERY NEARL TWO HUNDRED POUNDS AND MEASURING EIGHT FEET IN LENGTH FROM NOSE TO END OF TAIL SYDNEY SMITH SAYS THE KAN GAROO TAKES ABOUT FIVE HOPS TO EOVER A MILE BUT THE DOETOR IS EVIDENTLY INELINED TO EXAGGERATE MORE THAN WAS CAPTAIN COOK FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FEET MAY BE TAKEN AS THE OUTSIDE LIMIT OF A KAN GAROO S LEAP AND THAT ONLY WHEN HE IS TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM DANGER BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF AUSTRALIA THE NUMBERS OF THE KANGAROO WERE KEPT DOWN BY THE ABORIGI NALS AND THE DINGOES THE ABORIGINALS HUNTED THE KANGAROO FOR FOOD AND THE DINGO DID LIKE WISE THE DINGO IS THE NATIVE WILD DOG OF AUSTRALIA AND A VERY NEAR RELATIVE OF THE WOLF AND THE JACKAL HE IS FOND OF SHEEP AND THE SET TLERS FOUND IT NECESSARY TO KILL HIM OFF BY POISON AND IN OTHER WAYS IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THEIR FLOCKS THE ABORIGINALS DIMINISHED IN NUMBERS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR CONTACT WITH CIVILIZATION AND WITH THE REMOVAL OF HIS NATURAL ENEMIES THE KANGAROO INCREASED SO RAPIDLY THAT HE THREATENED TO KILL OFF THE SHEEP BY EATING UP ALL THE GRASS IN THE COUNTRY HE LIVES ENTIRELY ON GRASS AND CAN EAT A GREAT DEAL OF IT AND WHEN A HERD OR FLOCK OF KANGAROOS ESTAB A BATTLE WITH A KANGAROO 237 LISHES ITSELF ON A SHEEP RUN IT IS A VERY SERIOUS MAT TER FOR THE OWNER OF THE PLACE HENCE IT WAS NEC ESSARY TO HUNT HIM DOWN AND GET RID OF HIM THE GOVERNMENT GAVE A BOUNTY FOR THE SCALPS OF ALL KANGAROOS THAT WERE KILLED THE FLESH WAS USEFUL AS FOOD FOR MEN AND DOGS AND THE SKIN WAS FOUND TO BE USEFUL FOR MAKING LEATHER HUNTING THE KAN GAROO FURNISHES VERY FAIR SPORT AS THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF HARD RIDING AND SOME DANGER CONNECTED WITH IT AND THAT IS WHAT EVERY SPORTSMAN LIKES EVERY VISITOR TO AUSTRALIA IS REASONABLY SURE TO BE INVITED TO HUNT THE KANGAROO AND AS WE ARE VIS ITING THE LAND OF THE ANTIPODES JUST NOW WE WILL ACCEPT THE INVITATION WHILE WE ARE MAKING OUR PREPARATIONS LET US LISTEN TO THE STORY OF ONE WHO HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF EXPERIENCE IN THAT LINE OF SPORT MY FIRST HUNT IS HARDLY WORTHY THE NAME AS IT WAS MORE A SLAUGHTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE IT WAS A BATTUE OR DRIVE AND WAS INTENDED TO DISPOSE OF SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF THE ANIMALS AT ONCE A YARD WITH A FENCE SO HIGH THAT THE ANIMALS COULD NOT JUMP OVER IT WAS BUILT IN A CLUMP OF TREES ON A BROAD PLAIN WHERE KANGAROOS ABOUNDED IT WAS BUILT AMONG THE TREES SO THAT THE KANGAROOS WOULD NOT BE AWARE OF ITS EXISTENCE UNTIL TOO LATE FOR THEM TO ESCAPE THEN TOO WHEN THESE CREA TURES ARE PURSUED THEY ALWAYS RUN IN THE DIREC TION OF WATER AND THERE WAS A SMALL POND AMONG THE SCRUB WHERE THE YARD WAS FROM THE YARD 238 THE TALKING HANDKERCHIEF TWO FENCES THAT WIDENED OUT LIKE THE SIDES OF A V WERE BUILT OUT ON THE PLAIN FOR SEVERAL MILES AND EVERYBODY WAS MADE AWARE OF THEIR LOCALITY A DA WAS FIXED FOR THE DRIVE AND ALL THE SETTLERS TOGETHER WITH EVERY MAN WHITE OR BLACK WHO COULD BE SPARED FROM HIS DAILY DUTIES WAS EXPECTED TO COME AND JOIN IN THE RUN I WAS STOPPING WITH A FRIEND WHO HAD A LARGE SHEEP STATION AND WE WENT TO BED SOON AFTER SUN SET IN ORDER TO BE OFF THREE OR FOUR HOURS BEFORE DAYLIGHT AS WE REACHED THE PLAIN WE SPREAD OUT SO AS TO COVER A WIDE SWEEP THERE WERE TEN OR TWELVE MEN WITH MY FRIEND AND WE WERE ALL WELL MOUNTED AND AS WE SPREAD OUT IN A LONG LINE WE SOON FOUND THAT EACH END OF IT JOINED UPON SIMILAR LINES THE OBJECT WAS TO SWEEP OVER A GREAT AREA OF CQUNTRY AND DRIVE THE KANGAROOS INTO THE JAWS A BATTLE WITH A KANGAROO 239 OF THE V AS SOON AS THEY WERE WITHIN THE JAWS THEY WERE TO BE URGED ON TOWARD THE POINT WHERE THE FENCES CAME TOGETHER AT THE YARD THAT WE COVERED A GREAT DEAL OF COUNTRY YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IT WAS NEAR NOON WHEN WE GOT THE HERD INCLOSED IN THE JAWS OF THE FENCES AND TWO HOURS AFTER THAT TIME WHEN THEY WERE SAFELY YARDED THERE WERE EIGHT EEN HUNDRED AND MORE THE MOST OF THEM FULL GROWN AND IT SEEMED TO MY EXPERIENCED EYES THAT THERE WERE NEARER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND IT WAS A CURIOUS THING TO SEE THE PRODIGIOUS LEAPS THEY MADE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ENTERED THE YARD AND REALIZED THAT THEY WERE IN DANGER SOON AS THEY WERE YARDED THEY JUMPED WILDLY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER OF THE INCLOSURE AND VAINLY TRIED TO LEAP OVER THE FENCE A KANGAROO CAN EASIL JUMP OVER A HORSE AND A FENCE MUST BE NOT LESS THAN SEVEN FEET HIGH TO PREVENT HIS LEAPING IT THE FENCE OF OUR YARD WAS EIGHT LEET AT LEAST AND NOT A KANGAROO SUCCEEDED IN GETTING OVER IT HOW DID WE KILL THEM WELL WE DIDN T DO THE KILLING BUT THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS LEFT TO THE BLACKS AS WE CALL THE ABORIGINALS THAT WE EMPLOY ON THE SHEEP AND CATTLE STATIONS THE BLACKS HAVE A FIENDISH FONDNESS FOR SHEDDING BLOOD AND A KANGAROO DRIVE IS THEIR DELIGHT AS IT AFFORDS THEM A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR SLAUGHTER ARMED WITH CLUBS THEY WENT IN AMONG THE CREA TURES IN THE YARD AND THE SIGHT WAS SO SICKENING 240 THE TALKING HANDKERCHIEF THAT I SOON TURNED AWAY AND WENT TO THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE TREE CLUMP TO EAT THE LUNCHEON FOR WHICH ALL OF US HAD CREATED GOOD APPETITES BY OUR LONG RIDE A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS I HAD MY FIRST KANGAROO HUNT AND CAME VERY NEAR LOSING THE NUMBER OL MY MESS MY FRIEND HAD A PACK OF KANGAROO DOGS THAT WERE CONSIDERED THE BEST IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY THEY WERE BRED AND TRAINED FOR THAT PURPOSE JUST AS FOX HOUNDS ARE BRED AND TRAINED IN YOUR PART OF THE WORLD WE WERE MOUNTED ON TWO OF THE BEST HORSES ON THE STATION AND HAD TWO BLACKS ALONG ALSO WELL MOUNTED THEIR BUSI NESS BEING TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE DOGS AND MAKE THEMSELVES USEFUL A BLACK WAS SENT OUT TWO OR THREE HOURS AHEAD OF US TO LOCATE A GROUP OF KAN GAROOS AND MEET US AT A DESIGNATED POINT WE MET HIM AS AGREED AND HE INDICATED WHERE SOME KANGAROOS WERE FEEDING A LITTLE DISTANCE BEYOND A CLUMP OF TREES WHICH HE POINTED OUT"

TRYGVESON TO MEET HER AT KUNGAHALLA IN ORDER TO SETTLE ABOUT THEIR MAR RIAGE IT WAS STRANGE THAT KING OLAF WOULD MARRY QUEEN SIGRID FOR ALTHOUGH SHE WAS FAIR AND WELL GIFTED SHE WAS A WICKED HEATHEN WHILST KING OLAF WAS A CHRISTIAN WHO THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BUILDING CHURCHES AND COMPELLING THE PEOPLE TO BE BAPTIZED BUT MAYBE THE KING THOUGHT THAT GOD THE ALMIGHTY WOULD CONVERT HER BUT IT WAS EVEN MORE STRANGE THAT WHEN STOR RADE HAD ANNOUNCED TO KING OLAFS MESSENGER THAT SHE WOULD SET OUT FOR KUNGAHALLA AS SOON AS THE SEA WAS NO LONGER ICE BOUND SPRING SHOULD COME ALMOST IMMEDIATELY COLD AND SNOW DIS APPEARED AT THE TIME WHEN WINTER IS USUALLY AT ITS HEIGHT AND WHEN STORRADE MADE KNOWN THAT SHE WOULD BEGIN TO EQUIP HER SHIPS THE ICE VANISHED FROM THE FJORDS THE MEADOWS BECAME EEEN AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS YET A LONG TIME TO IDY DAY THE CATTLE COULD ALREADY BE PUT OUT TO GRASS WHEN THE QUEEN ROWED BETWEEN THE ROCKS OF EAST GOTHLAND INTO THE BALTIC SHE HEARD THE CUCKOO S SONG ALTHOUGH IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE H57 FROM A SFFE DISH HOMESTEAD REAR THAT ONE COULD SCARCELY EXPECT TO HEAR THE ARK AND GREAT JOY PREVAILED EVERYWHERE WHEN STOR RADE PROCEEDED ON HER WAY ALL THE TROLLS WHO HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO FLEE FROM NORWAY DURING KING OLAF S REIGN BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT BEAR THE SOUND OF THE CHURCH BELLS CAME ON THE ROCKS WHEN THEY SAW STORRADE SAILING PAST THEY PULLED UP YOUNG BIRCH TREES BY THE ROOTS AND WAVED THEM TO THE QUEEN AND THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR ROCKY DWELLINGS WHERE THEIR WIVES WERE SITTING FULL OF LONGING AND ANXIETY AND SAID WOMAN THOU SHALT NOT BE CAST DOWN ANY LONGER STORRADE IS NOW SAILING TO KING OLAF NOW WE SHALL SOON RETURN TO NORWAY WHEN THE QUEEN SAILED PAST KULLEN THE KULLA TROLL CAME OUT OF HIS CAVE AND HE MADE THE BLACK MOUNTAIN OPEN SO THAT SHE SAW THE GOLD AND SILVER VEINS WHICH TWISTED THROUGH IT AND IT MADE THE QUEEN HAPPY TO SEE HIS RICHES WHEN STORRADE WENT PAST THE HOLLAND RIVERS THE NIXIE CAME DOWN FROM HIS WATERFALL SWAM RIGHT OUT TO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AND PLAYED UPON HIS HARP SO THAT THE SHIP DANCED UPON THE WAVES WHEN SHE SAILED PAST THE NIDINGE ROCKS THE MERMEN LAY THERE AND BLEW UPON THEIR SEASHELL HORNS AND MADE THE WATER SPLASH IN FROTHY PILLARS AND WHEN THE WIND WAS AGAINST THEM THE MOST LOATHSOME TROLLS CAME OUT OF THE DEEP TO HELP STORRADE S SHIP OVER THE WAVES SOME LAY AT THE STERN AND PUSHED OTHERS TOOK ROPES OF SEAWEED IN THEIR MOUTH AND HARNESSED THEM SELVES BEFORE THE SHIP LIKE HORSES 158 SIGRID STORRXDE THE WILD HEATHEN WHOM KING OLAF WOULD NOT ALLOW TO REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR GREAT WICKEDNESS CAME ROWING TOWARDS THE QUEEN S SHIP WITH SAILS FURLED AND WITH THEIR POLE AXES RAISED AS IF FOR ATTACK BUT WHEN THEY RECOGNISED THE QUEEN THEY ALLOWED HER TO PASS UNHURT AND SHOUTED AFTER HER WE EMPTY A BEAKER TO THY WEDDING STOR RADE ALL THE HEATHEN WHO LIVED ALONG THE COAST LAID FIREWOOD UPON THEIR STONE ALTARS AND SACRIFICED BOTH SHEEP AND GOATS TO THE OLD GODS IN ORDER THAT THEY SHOULD AID STORRADE IN HER EXPEDITION TO THE NORWEGIAN KING WHEN THE QUEEN SAILED UP THE NORTHERN RIVER A MERMAID SWAM ALONGSIDE THE SHIP STRETCHED HER WHITE ARM OUT OF THE WATER AND GAVE HER A LARGE CLEAR PEARL WEAR THIS STORRADE SHE SAID THEN KING OLAF WILL BE SO BEWITCHED BY THY BEAUTY THAT HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FORGET THEE WHEN THE QUEEN HAD SAILED A SHORT DISTANCE UP THE RIVER SHE HEARD SUCH A ROAR AND SUCH A RUSHING NOISE THAT SHE EXPECTED TO FIND A WATER FALL THE FURTHER SHE PROCEEDED THE LOUDER GREW THE NOISE BUT WHEN SHE ROWED PAST THE GOLDEN ISLE AND PASSED INTO A BROAD BAY SHE SAW AT THE RIVERSIDE THE GREAT KUNGAHALLA THE TOWN WAS SO LARGE THAT AS FAR AS SHE COULD SEE UP THE RIVER THERE WAS HOUSE AFTER HOUSE ALL IMPOSING AND WELL TIMBERED WITH MANY OUT HOUSES NARROW LANES BETWEEN THE GRAY WOODEN WALLS LED DOWN TO THE RIVER THERE WERE LARGE COURTVARDS BEFORE THE DWELLING HOUSES WELL LAID 1591 FR M N SITEDISH HOMESTEAD PATHWAYS WONT FROM EACH HOUSE DOWN TO ITS BOATHOU E AND LANDING SIAGE STORRADO COMMANDED HER MEN TO ROW QUITE SLOWLY SHE HERSELF STOOD ON THE POOP OF THE SHIP AND LOOKED TOWARDS THE SHORE NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN THE LIKE OF THIS SHE SAID SHE NOW UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ROAR SHE HAD HEARD WAS NOTHING BUT THE NOISE OF THE WORK WHICH WENT ON AT KUNGAHALLA IN THE SPRING WHEN THE SHIPS WERE BEING MADE READY FOR THEIR LONE CRUISES SHE HEARD THE SMITHS HANUNERING WITH HUGE SLEDGE HAMMERS THE BAKER S SHOVEL CLAT TERED IN THE OVENS BEAMS WERE HOISTED ON TO HEAVY LIGHTERS WITH MUCH CRASHING NOISE YOUNG MEN PLANED OARS AND STRIPPED THE BARK FROM THE TREES WHICH WERE TO BE USED FOR MASTS SHE SAW GREEN COURTYARDS WHERE HANDMAIDENS WERE TWINING ROPES FOR THE SEAFARING MEN AND WHERE OLD MEN SAT MENDING THE G Y WADMAL SAILS SHE SAW THE BOAT BUILDERS TARRING THE NEW BOATS ENORMOUS NAILS WERE DRIVEN INTO STRONG OAKEN PLANKS THE HULLS OF THE SHIPS WERE HAULED OUT OF THE BOATHOUSES TO BE TIGHTENED OLD SHIPS WERE DONE UP WITH FRESHLY PAINTED

THE FRENCH SOLDIERY ON THE 21ST WE CAME TO OFF ST PHILOU WHICH HAD JUST BEEN PLUNDERED OF EVERYTHING NOTHING MATERIAL OCCURRED TILL THE 30TH WHEN BEAT ING UP TOWARDS CALDAGUES BAY WE RECEIVED INTELHGENCE THAT SEVERAL FRENCH VESSELS BOUND TO BARCELONA WITH PROVISIONS FOR THE REHEF OF THE FRENCH ARMY WERE AT ANCHOR THERE TO ATTACK THESE AS WE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE BODY OF THE ENEMY AT CALDAGUES AND AS THE HARBOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF A MILE BROAD WAS A DANGEROUS AFFAIR ON ACCOUNT OF THE NECESSITY OF ANCHORING WITHIN POINT BLANK RANGE OF MUSKETRY IT WAS HOWEVER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT THE PROVISIONS SHOULD NOT REACH THEK DESTINATION AND IN PLACE OF WAITING FOR THEM TO PROCEED ON THEIR VOYAGE I DECIDED ON ATTACKING THEM AS THE CONVOY LAY AT ANCHOR AT MID DAY WE WERE CLOSE TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE HARBOUR AND MADE OUT THE CONVOY AND TWO VESSELS OF WAR IN CHARGE OF THEM THE WHOLE BEING PROTECTED BY A BATTERY AND A NUMBER OF FRENCH TROOPS ON

ON HER BROADSIDE AND WAS FULL OF WATER WHICH BEING PUMPED OUT SHE FLOATED AND WAS TOWED ALONGSIDE THE FRIGATE BY THIS TIME A NUMBER OF SPANISH BOATS FROM THE NEIGHBOURING COAST CAME IN AND WITHOUT

HEALTH WHICH HAD IN REAHTY SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM THE INCESSANT WEAR AND TEAR OF BODY AND MIND TO WHICH FOR NEARLY TWO APPLY FOR LEAVE S33 YEARS I HAD BEEN EXPOSED A MORE URGENT REASON WAS TO GET BACK TO MY PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN ORDER TO EXPOSE THE ROBBERIES OF THE ADMIRALTY COURTS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN THE OFFICIALS OF WHICH WERE REAPING COLOSSAL FORTUNES AT THE EXPENSE OF NAVAL OFFICERS AND SEAMEN WHO WERE WASTING THEIR HVES AND BLOOD FOR OFFICIAL GAIN THE BAREFACED PECULATIONS OF THESE COURTS WOULD BE ALMOST INCREDIBLE ESPECIALLY AS REGARDED THE MALTESE COURT WERE THERE NOT SOME HVING AT THE PRESENT TIME WHO CAN TESTIFY TO THEIR ENOR MITY TO SUCH AN EXTENT WAS THIS NOW CARRIED THAT A SHIP CAPTM ED WITHOUT CARGO NEVER YIELDED A PENNY TO THE CAPTORS THE WHOLE PROCEEDS BEING SWALLOWED UP BY THE ADMIRALTY COURT WITH CARGO SOME TRIFLING SURPLUS MIGHT REMAIN BUT WHAT BETWEEN PILFERING AND OFFICIAL FEES THE AWARD WAS HARDLY WORTH THE TROUBLE OF CAPTURE THE EFFECT OF THIS UPON THE NAVY GENERALLY WAS MOST DISASTROUS AND NOT UPON THE NAVY ONLY BUT UPON THE NATION ALSO WHICH HAD UPWARDS OF 1000 SHIPS IN COM MISSION WITHOUT ANY RESULT AT ALL COMMENSURABLE WITH THE EXPENDITURE CAPTAINS WERE NATURALLY DISINCLINED TO HARASS THEMSELVES AND CREWS FOR NOTHING AND AVOIDED MAKING PRIZES CERTAIN TO YIELD NOTHING BUT THE RISK AND TROUBLE OF CAPTURE AND WHICH IN ADDITION MIGHT BRING THEM IN DEBT AS WAS THE RESULT IN MY OWN CASE IT WILL NOW BE EVIDENT WHY I PREFERRED HARASSING THE FRENCH ARMY IN SPAIN TO MAKING PRIZES FOR THE ENRICHMENT OF THE OFFICIALS OF THE MALTESE AND OTHER ADMIRALTY COURTS IT WAS ALWAYS MY AIM TO SERVE MY COUNTRY BEFORE MY OWN INTERESTS AND IN THIS CASE I 334 MOTIVES FOR LEAVING JUDGED IT BETTER TO DO SO WHERE THE SERVICE COULD BE MOST EFFECTUAL PRIZES OF WHICH THE PROCEEDS WERE MONOPOLISED BY A BODY OF CORRUPT OFFICIALS NEITHER UNDER THE EYE NOR CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT WERE NOT WORTH TROUBLING OURSELVES ABOUT SO I DETERMINED ON A COM SE OF SERVICE WHERE THERE WERE NO PRIZES TO TAKE BUT ABUNDANCE OF HIGHLY INTERESTING OPERATIONS TO BE UNDERTAKEN THE FRIGATE S OFFICERS AND CREW WILUNGLY SECONDING MY VIEWS I NOW MORE ON THEIR ACCOUNT THAN MY OWN PUT ON RECORD THAT NONE OF THE SER VICES PREVIOUSLY NARRATED THOUGH LAUDED BY THE AD MIRALS COMMANDING THEM AND BY HISTORIANS SUBSE QUENTLY WERE EVER REWARDED EITHER AS REGARDED MY SELF OR ANY ONE UNDER MY COMMAND EVEN PROMOTION TO THE OFFICERS BEING SHAMEFULLY WITHHELD THEIR FAULT OR RATHER MISFORTUNE CONSISTING IN HAVIUI SERVED UNDER MY COMMAND MY CHIEF MOTIVE HOWEVER FOR WISLIING TO RETURN TO ENGLAND WAS THAT DURING OUR OPERATIONS AGAINST THE FRENCH ON THE SPANISH COAST I HAD SEEN SO MUCH OF THEM AS TO CON T NCE ME THAT IF WITH A SINGLE FRIGATE I COULD PARALYSE THE MOVEMENTS OF THEIR ARMIES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WITH THREE OR FOM SHIPS IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT SO TO SPREAD TERROR ON THEIR ATLANTIC SHORES AS TO RENDER IT UNPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SEND AN ARMY INTO WESTERN SPAIN MY OBJECT THEN WAS AS FI OM LONG AND UNCEASING EXPERIENCE I CONSIDERED MYSELF EN TITLED TO THE COMMAND OF MORE THAN ONE SHIP TO PROPOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE FRENCH ISLANDS IN THE BAY OF BISCAY AND TO LET ME WDTH A SMALL SQUADRON OPERATE AGAMST THE ENEMY S SEA APATHY OF THE GOVERXMENT FM BOARD THERE AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY DONE WITH THE SPEED AND IMPERIEUSE FROM MONTPEUIER TO BARCELONA HAD THIS PERMISSION BEEN GRANTED I DO NOT HESITATE TO STAKE MY PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION THAT NEITHER THE PENINSULAR WAR NOR ITS ENORMOUS COST TO THE NATION FROM 1809 ONWARDS WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN HEARD OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY AS IT IVILL ALWAYS HE EASY IN CASE OF FUTURE WARS THAT IS PROVIDED THOSE WHO HAVE THE DIRECTION OF NATIONAL AFFAIRS HAVE THE SAGACITY TO FORESEE DISASTER AND FORESEEING IT TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE SO TO HARASS THE FRENCH COAST AS TO FIND FIILL EMPLOY MENT FOR THEIR TROOPS AT HOME AND THUS TO RENDER ANY OPERATIONS IN WESTERN SPAIN OR EVEN IN FOREIGN COUN TRIES NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE BY MEMBERS NOT AWARE OF THIS POWER OF HARASSING AN ENEMY S COAST BY MEANS OF A FEW FRIGATES THE MINISTRY WAS GREATLY BLAMED FOR NOT HAVING SENT A MIHTARY FORCE TO CATALONIA INSTEAD OF DESPATCHING THE VERY INADEQUATE FORCE UNDER SIR JOHN MOORE TO THE WESTERN SHORES OF THE PENINSULA THAT THE LATTER STEP WAS A GREAT MISTAKE LIKELY ONLY TO END IN DISASTER IS NOW ADMITTED BUT WHAT I CONTEND FOR IS THAT NO MIHTARY FORCE WAS AT ALL NEEDED IN SPAIN HAD THE GOVERNMENT SEIZED AND HELD BY A COMPARATIVELY SMALL MILITARY FORCE THE ISLES ON THE COAST OF FRANCE VIZ ISLES DIEU EHE OLERON AND A FEW OTHERS FOLLOWING UP OR PRECEDING THIS SEIZURE BY A LIMITED NUMBER OF ACTIVE FRIGATES HARASSING THE WHOLE WESTERN COAST OF FRANCE WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEND A SINGLE REGIMENT INTO SPAIN AND HENCE AS HAS BEEN SAID WE SHOULD HAVE HAD NO PENINSULAR WAR WITH ITS HUNDREDS OF MILHONS OF 336 REPROACHED FOR SERVICE NATIONAL DEBT HAD TLIE FRENCH BEEN THUS EMPLOYED IN THE DEFENCE OF THEIR OWN COASTS THE SPANIARDS ON THE WEST COAST WOULD HAVE BEEN A MATCH FOR THEIR ENEMIES AS WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A FEW SMALL BRITISH FRIGATES THEY WERE RENDERED A MATCH FOR THEM ON THE EAST COAST THIS WAS THE WORK I WAS PREPARED TO RECOMMEND TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CONSIDERING MOREOVER THAT FROM THE PART THE IINPCRIEUSE HAD TAKEN IN HARASSING THE ENEMY ON THE EAST COAST OF SPAIN I WAS FAIRLY EN TITLED TO ASK THAT ANY SMALL SQUADRON OF FRIGATES AP POINTED FOR THE PIU POSE OF OPERATING ON THE WEST COAST OF FRANCE SHOULD BE PLACED UNDER MY COMMAND HOW MY PLANS FOR THIS END AND TOGETHER WITH THEM MY OWN CAREER AS A NAVAL OFFICER WERE SACRIFICED BY AN OCCURRENCE WHICH FORMS THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT CHAP TERS WILL THERE BE SEEN"

FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SO EMINENTLY ADORNED IT BY THEIR GALLANTRY AND SKILL I WAS FIFTH OR JUNIOR LIEUTENANT OF THE VALIANT ON THE MORTIFYING OCCASION ABOVE MENTIONED AND CAN BEAR TESTIMONY TO THE IADIFJNATION WHICH PERVADED THE TVHOLE FLEET IN LUIT NESSING THE TOTAL IVANT OF ENTERPRISE AND EVEN COMMON SENSE OF DUTY WHICH THEN PERMITTED SO MANY OF THE ENEMY S SHIPS TO ESCAPE WHEN THEY LUERE ENTIRELY AT OUR MERCY I HAVE HOWEVER TO MENTION SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAY THROW LIGHT UPON THE MYSTIFIED DESPATCH OF LORD GRAM BIER WHICH CERTAINLY SURPRISED ALL THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT IN THE FIRST PLACE LORD GRAMBIER CAN HAVE GIVEN NO POSITIVE ORDERS TO CAPT BLIGH OF THE VCDIANT TO ATTACK THE FRENCH SHIPS WHICH WERE AGROUND AT THE TIME INDICATED IN THE DE SPATCH FOR AFTER WE HAD ANCHORED OFF THE BOYART SHOAL CAPT BLIGH SEEING YOU GO IN WITH THE IMPERIEUSE UNSUPPORTED AFTER WAITING SOME TIME EXJDECTING TO BE ORDERED BY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO ASSIST YOU WENT IN HIS GIG ON BOARD THE CCDEDONIA TO VOLUIDEER HIS SERVICES LORD GAMBIER EXPRESSED HIMSELF GREATLY OBLIGED BUT SAID SOME OTHER SHIP MUST ACCOMPANY UPON WHICH CAPT BLIGH SELECTED THE RE VENGE FROM REGARD FOR CAPT KERR WHO HAD BEEN ACTING FOR HIM IN THE VALIANT SOME TIME BEFORE WHEN HE HAD OCCASION TO GO ON LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR PRIVATE AFFAIRS AVE ACCORDINGLY RAN IN AS YOUR LORDSHIP HAS DETAILED AND I HAVE NOTHING TO REMARK AS TO WHAT FOLLOWED BUT ONE CIRCUM STANCE OF WHICH YOUR LORDSHIP DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN AWARE NO DOUBT YOU WOULD HAVE OBSERVED THAT ON THE EVENINCT OF THE 12TH THE CREWS OF THE OCEAN AND TWO OTHER ENEMY S LINE OF BATTLE SHIPS NEAR HER WERE EYIDENTLJ FLYING FROM THEM IN A PANIC NUMEROUS BOATS FROM THE SHORE AS SISTING IN CONVEYING THEM FROM THE SHIPS 4S EXE I Y S SHIPS ABAXDOXED BY TIIEIK CRRVRS THIS WAS SO APIJARENT THAT OUR CAPTAIN BLIGLI WENT IN HIS GIG WITH TWO OTHER CAPTAINS AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK TO RECONNOITRE THESE SHIPS WITH A VIEW TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THEM WITH L OATS IF THEY WERE DESERTED THESE CAPTAINS RETURNED HOWEVER REPORTING THAT THEY HAD FOUND THEM SURI OUNDED BY BOATS SEE AND THAT CONSE QUENTLY THEY COULD NOT BE ATTACKED IN TLIE MORNING HOW EVER NO BOATS WERE NEAR THEM NOR WERE ANY PERSONS SEEN STIRRING ON BOARD THEM AND IT WAS NOT TILL ABOUT TEN O CLOCK I THINK THAT THE CXE YS FIND IN THAT WE HAD NOT TAL EN POS SESSION TOOK COURAGE VENTURED TO RETURN ON BOARD THEIR SHIPS AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO IVARP THEM BUT OF OUR REACH CAPTAIN BLIGH WAS A MAN OF THE FIRMEST NERVE I EVER KNEW AND THEREFORE I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE THAT THE BOATS HE SAW WERE STILL ENGAGED CARRYING THE CREWS ON SHORE THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS AT LEAST TEN O CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN HE WENT TO RECONNOITRE AND I KNOW AVE WERE GREATLY PUZZLED AT THE TIME TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THESE BOATS AS A PROOF THAT THESE SHIPS WERE TOTALLY DESERTED THAT NIGHT I NEED ONLY REFER YOUR LORDSHIP TO THE ACCOUNT OF ADMIRAL GRRAVIERE QUOTED BY YOU WHERE HE SAYS THE PA NIC WAS SO GREAT THAT SA S WHICH HAD NOT EVEN BEEN ATTACKED WERE ABANDONED BY THEIR CREWS BUT MY LORD WE HEARD SOON AFTER THIS DISGRACEFUL AFFAIR BV MEANS OF SOME FRENCH VESSEL WHICH HAD BEEN BOARDED OR TAKEN THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE I DO NOT NOW PERFECTLY RECOL LECT JICNV THIS INFORMATION REACHED US BUT WE HAD NO DOUBT OF THE FACT AT THE TIME IT BEING ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR OWN OBSERVATIONS AND CONJECTURES I EXCEEDINGLY REGRET THAT I DID NOT MAKE NOTE OF THIS AT THE TIME BUT THE BELIEF IN THE FACT OF THE CREWS HAVING DESERTED THOSE THREE SHIPS AVAS SO GENERAL AND UNDOUBTED THAT IT NEVER OCCUI RED TO ME THAT IT MIGHT BE QUESTIONED THE REPORT AVENT FURTHER AND ADDED ONE SINGULAR CIRCUM STANCE THAT THERE AVAS O E MAN AVHO DID REMAIN AVHEN ALL THE REMAINDER OF THE CREWS HAD QUITTED THIS AVAS A QUARTER A MIDSHIPMAN NEAR TAKING THE FLAG SHIP 49 MASTER ON BOARD THE OCEAN WHO INDIGNANT AT THE COWARDLY DESERTION OF THE SHIPS JUD JTIMSELF WHEN THE CREWS WERE ORDERED TO QNIT AND THIS WAS THE SALVATION OF THAT THREE DECKER AND THE TWO OTHER SHIPS IN A VERY EXTRAORDINARY WAY A LITTLE MIDSHIPMAN BELONGING TO ONE OF OUR SMALLER VESSELS I BELIEVE A BRIG HAD BEEN SENT IN A JOLLJ BOAT THAT NIGHT WITH A MESSAGE TO ANOTHER SHIP AND HAVING DELIVERED IT INSTEAD OF RETURNING IMMEDIATELY TO HIS OWN VESSEL HE PROPOSED TO HIS MEN TO GO AND LOOK AT THE FRENCH SHIPS FROM WHICH THE CREWS HAD BEEN SEEN TO FLY HIS MEN OF COURSE WERE WILLING AND THEY APPROACHED CAUTIOUSLY VEI Y NEAR TO THE THREE DECKER THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK BEFORE THEY COULD OBSERVE ANY STIR ON BOARD OR AROUND HER THEY WERE THEN SUDDENLY HAILED BY THE QUARTER MASTER BEFORE MENTIONED WITH A LOUD QUI VIVE OF COURSE THE POOR LITTLE MIDSHIPMAN TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE SHIP WAS OCCUPIED BY MORE THAN THAT ONE MAN AND HE HASTILY RETREATED GLAD TO ESCAPE CAPTURE HIMSELF BUT HAD HE KNOWN THE TRUTH THAT LITTLE MKJSHLPMAN LUITH HIS JOLLY BOAT AND FOUR MEN MIGHT HAVE TAKEN POSSESSION OF A THREE DECKER AND TWO SEVENTY FOURS THIS SEEMS MORE LIKE A STORY OF ROMANCE THAN AN ACTUAL OCCURRENCE AND I GREATLY REGRET TLIAT I DID NOT THEN MAKE NOTE OF EVERY NAME AND CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME I CANNOT CALL TO MIND BUT I HAVE NEVER ENTERTAINED ANY DOUBTS AS TO THE FACTS HERE DETAILED AND I HAVE ALWAYS MENTIONED THEM IN SPEAKING OF THAT MOST UNSATISFACTORY AFFAIR OF BASQUE ROADS ADMIRAL GRRAVIERE S ACCOUNT IS A POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF AVHAT WE OBSERVED AND FULLY BELIEVED AS TO THE ABANDONMENT OF THE SHIPS AND I ONLY WONDER THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE MENTIONED THE NOBLE CONDUCT OF THE QUARTER MASTER"

INFLUENCE WHICH GROUND EXERCISES ON THE USE OF TROOPS HERE MANY OF THE SACRED RELICS OF MILITARY ERUDITION HAVE THEIR ROOT AS FOR INSTANCE COM MANDING POSITIONS KEY POSITIONS STRATE GIC MANOEUVRES ETC WE SHALL TAKE AS DEAR A VIEW OF THE SUBJECT AS WE CAN WITHOUT PROLIXITY AND PASS IN REVIEW THE TRUE AND THE FALSE REALITY AND EXAGGERA TION EVERY EXERTION OF PHYSICAL FORCE IF MADE UPWARDS IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN IF IT IS MADE IN THE CONTRARY DIRECTION DOWN WARDS CONSEQUENTLY IT MUST BE SO IN FIGHTING AND THERE ARE THREE EVIDENT REA SONS WHY IT IS SO FIRST EVERY HEIGHT MAY BE REGARDED AS AN OBSTACLE TO APPROACH SECONDLY ALTHOUGH THE RANGE IS NOT PER CEPTIBLY GREATER IN SHOOTING DOWN FROM A HEIGHT YET ALL GEOMETRICAL RELATIONS BEING TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF HITTING THAN IN THE OP POSITE CASE THIRDLY AN ELEVATION GIVES A BETTER COMMAND OF VIEW HOW ALL THESE ADVANTAGES UNITE THEMSELVES TOGETHER IN BATTLE WE ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH HERE WE COLLECT THE SUM TOTAL OF THE ADVAN TAGES WHICH TACTICS DERIVES FROM ELEVATION OF POSITION AND COMBINE THEM IN ONE WHOLE WHICH WE REGARD AS THE FIRST STRA TEGIC ADVANTAGE BUT THE FIRST AND LAST OF THESE ADVAN TAGES THAT HAVE BEEN ENUMERATED MUST APPEAR ONCE MORE AS ADVANTAGES OF STRA TEGY ITSELF FOR WE MARCH AND RECONNOITRE IN STRATEGY AS WELL AS IN TACTICS IF THERE FORE AN ELEVATED POSITION IS AN OBSTACLE TO THE APPROACH OF THOSE ON LOWER GROUND THAT IS THE SECOND AND THE BETTER COM MAND OF VIEW WHICH THIS ELEVATED POSITION AFFORDS IS THE THIRD ADVANTAGE WHICH STRA TEGY MAY DERIVE IN THIS WAY OF THESE ELEMENTS IS COMPOSED THE POWER OF DOMINATING OVERLOOKING COM MANDING FROM THESE SOURCES SPRINGS THE SENSE OF SUPERIORITY AND SECURITY WHICH IS FELT IN STANDING ON THE BROW OF A HILL AND LOOKING AT THE ENEMY BELOW AND THE FEELING OF WEAKNESS AND APPREHENSION WHICH PERVADES THE MINDS OF THOSE BELOW PERHAPS THE TOTAL IMPRESSION MADE IS AT THE SAME TIME STRONGER THAN IT OUGHT TO BE BECAUSE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGH ER GROUND STRIKES THE SENSES MORE THAN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MODIFY THAT AD VANTAGE PERHAPS THE IMPRESSION MADE SURPASSES THAT WHICH THE TRUTH WARRANTS IN WHICH CASE THE EFFECT OF IMAGINATION MUST BE REGARDED AS A NEW ELEMENT WHICH EXAGGERATES THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY AN ELEVATION OF GROUND AT THE SAME TIME THE ADVANTAGE OF GREATER FACILITY OF MOVEMENT IS NOT AB SOLUTE AND NOT ALWAYS IN FAVOUR OF THE SIDE OCCUPYING THE HIGHER POSITION IT IS ONLY SO WHEN HIS OPPONENT WISHES TO ATTACK HIM IT IS NOT IF THE COMBATANTS ARE SEPARATED BY A GREAT VAUEY AND IT IS ACTUALLY IN FAVOUR OF THE ARMY ON THE LOWER GROUND IF BOTH WISH TO FIGHT IN THE PLAIN BATTLE OF HOHENMEDBERG ALSO THE POWER OF OVERLOOKING OR COM MAND OF VIEW HAS LIKEWISE GREAT LIMITA TIONS A WOODED COUNTRY IN THE VALLEY BELOW AND OFTEN THE VERY MASSES OF THE MOUNTAINS THEMSELVES ON WHICH WE STAND OBSTRUCT THE VISION COUNTLESS ARE THE CASES IN WHICH WE MIGHT SEEK IN VAIN ON THE SPOT FOR THOSE ADVANTAGES CHAP XVNI COMMAND OF GROUND 65 OF AN EIEVATAD POSITION WLUCH A MAP WOULD LEAD US TO EXPECT AND WE MIGHT OFTEN BE LED TO THINK WE HAD ONLY IN VOLVED OURSELVES IN ALL KINDS OF DISADVAN TAGES THE VERY OPPOSITE OF THE ADVANTAGES WE COUNTED UPON BUT THESE LIMITATIONS AND CONDITIONS DO NOT ABROGATE OR DE STROY THE SUPERIORITY WHICH THE MORE ELEVATED POSITION CONFERS BOTH ON THE DEFENSIVE AND OFFENSIVE WE SHALL POINT OUT IN A FEW WORDS HOW THIS IS THE CASE WITH EACH OUT OF THE THREE STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES OF THE MORE ELEVATED GROUND THE GREATER TACTICAL STRENGTH THE MARE DIFFICULT APPROACH AND THE BETTER VIEW THE FIRST TWO ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT THEY BELONG REALLY TO THE DEFENSIVE ONLY FOR IT IS ONLY IN HOLDING FIRMLY TO A POSITION THAT WE CAN MAKE USE OF THEM WHILST THE OTHER SIDE OFFEN SIVE IN MOVING CANNOT REMOVE THEM AND TAKE THEM WI HIM BUT THE THIRD AD VANTAGE CAN BE MADE USE OF BY THE OFFEN SIVE JUST AS WELL AS BY THE DEFENSIVE FROM THIS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE MORE ELEVATED GROUND IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT TO THE DEFENSIVE AND AS IT CAN ONLY BE MAINTAINED IN A DECISIVE WAY IN MOUN TAINOUS COUNTRIES THEREFORE IT WOULD SEEM TO FOLLOW AS A CONSEQUENCE THAT THE DEFENSIVE HAS AN IMPORTANT ADVAN TAGE IN MOUNTAIN POSITIONS HOW IT IS THAT THROUGH OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THIS IS NOT SO IN REALITY WE SHALL SHOW IN THE CHAPTER ON THE DEFENCE OF MOUNTAINS WE MUST FIRST OF ALL MAKE A DISTINC TION IF THE QUESTION RELATES MERELY TO COMMANDING GROUND AT ONE SINGLE POINT AS FOR EXAMPLE A POSITION FOR AN ARMY IN SUCH CASE THE STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES RATHER MERGE IN THE TACTICAL ONE OF A BATTLE FOUGHT UNDER ADVANTAGEOUS CIR CUMSTANCES BUT IF NOW WE IMAGINE A CONSIDERABLE TRACT OF COUNTRY SUP POSE A WHOLE PROVINCE AS A REGULAR SLOPE LIKE THE DECLIVITY AT A GENERAL WATERSHED SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SEVERAL MARCHES AND ALWAYS HOLD THE UPPER GROUND THEN THE STRATEGIC AD TOU II VANTAGES BECOME GREATER BECAUSE WE CAN NOW USE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE MORE ELEVATED GROUND NOT ONLY IN THE COMBI NATION OF OUR FORCES WITH EACH OTHER FOR ONE PARTICULAR COMBAT BUT ALSO IN THE COMBINATION OF SEVERAL COMBATS WITH ONE ANOTHER THUS IT IS WITH THE DEFENSIVE AS REGARDS THE OFFENSIVE IT ENJOYS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE SAME ADVANTAGES AS THE DEFENSIVE FROM THE MORE ELEVATED GROUND FOR THIS REASON THAT THE STRA GETIC ATTACK IS NOT CONFINED TO ONE ACT LIKE THE TACTICAL THE STRATEGIC ADVANCE IS NOT THE CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT OF A PIECE OF WHEEHVORK IT IS MADE IN SINGLE MARCHES WITH A LONGER OR SHORTER INTERVAL BETWEEN THEM AND AT EACH HALTING POINT THE ASSAILANT IS JUST AS MUCH ACTING ON THE DEFENSIVE AS HIS ADVERSARY THROUGH THE ADVANTAGE OF A BETTER VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY AN ELEVATED POSITION CONFERS IN A CERTAIN MEASURE ON THE OFFENSIVE AS WELL AS THE DEFENSIVE A POWER OF ACTION WHICH WE MUST NOT OMIT TO NOTICE IT IS THE FACILITY OF OPERATING WITH SEPARATE MASSES FOR EACH PORTION OF A FORCE SEPARATELY DERIVES THE SAME ADVANTAGES WHICH THE WHOLE DERIVES FROM THIS MORE ELEVATED POSITION BY THIS A SEPARATE CORPS LET IT BE STRONG OR WEAK IN NUMBERS IS STRONGER THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AND WE CAN VENTURE TO TAKE UP A POSITION WITH LESS DANGER THAN WE COULD IF IT HAD NOT THAT PARTICU LAR PROPERTY OF BEING ON AN ELEVATION THE ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE TO BE DERIVED FROM SUCH SEPARATE BODIES OF TROOPS IS A SUBJECT FOR ANOTHER PLACE"

FORTRESSES THE LAYING SIEGE TO THEM OR NOT WILL DEPEND ON OUR MEANS IF WE HAVE A GREAT SUPERIORITY OF FORCE IT WOULD BE A LOSS OF TIME NOT TO TAKE THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT IF WE ARE NOT CERTAIN OF

SUSPEND OTIR STRATEGIC ADVANCE THAT ADVANCE AS A RULE HAS REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT WE DEMAND THERE FORE THAT THE MAIN BODY SHOULD PRESS FORWARD RAPIDLY IN PURSUIT WITHOUT ANY REST WE HAVE ALREADY CONDEMNED THE IDEA OF ALLOWING THE ADVANCE TOWARDS THE PRINCIPAL POINT BEING MADE DEPENDENT ON SUCCESS AT SECONDARY POINTS THE CON SEQUENCE OF THIS IS THAT IN ALL ORDINARY CASES OUR CHIEF ARMY ONLY KEEPS BEHIND IT A NARROW STRIP OF TERRITORY WHICH IT CAN CALL ITS OWN AND WHICH THEREFORE CONSTI TUTES ITS THEATRE OF WAR HOW THIS WEAKENS THE MOMENTUM AT THE HEAD AND THE DANGERS FOR THE OFFENSIVE ARISING THEREFROM WE HAVE SHOWN ALREADY WILL NOT THIS DIFFICULTY WILL NOT THIS INTRINSIC COUNTERPOISE COME TO A POINT WHICH IM PEDES FARTHER ADVANCE CERTAINLY THAT MAY OCCUR BUT JUST AS WE HAVE ALREADY INSISTED THAT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO TRY TO AVOID THIS CONTRACTED THEATRE OF WAR AT THE COMMENCEMENT AND FOR THE SAKE OF THAT OBJECT TO ROB THE ADVANCE OF ITS ELASTICITY SO WE ALSO NOW MAINTAIN THAT AS LONG AS THE COMMANDER HAS NOT YET OVERTHROWN HIS OPPONENT AS LOI AS HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF STRONG ENOUGH TO EFFECT THAT OBJECT SO LONG MUST HE ALSO PURSUE IT HE DOES SO PERHAPS AT AN INCREASED RISK BUT ALSO WITH THE PROSPECT OF A GREATER SUCCESS IF HE REACHES A POINT WHICH HE CANNOT VENTURE TO GO BEYOND WHERE IN ORDER TO PROTECT HIS REAR HE MUST EXTEND HIMSELF RIGHT AND LEFT WELT THEN THIS IS MOST PROBABLY HIS CULMINAT ING POINT THE POWER OF FLIGHT IS SPENT AND IF THE ENEMY IS NOT SUBDUED MOST PROBABLY HE WILL NOT BE NOW ALL THAT THE ASSAILANT NOW DOES TO IN TENSIFY HIS ATTACK BY CONQUEST OF FOR TRESSES DEFILES PROVINCES IS NO DOUBT STILL A SLOW ADVANCE BUT IT IS ONLY OF A RELATIVE KIND IT IS NO LONGER ABSOLUTE THE ENEMY IS NO LONGER IN FLIGHT HE IS PERHAPS PREPARING A RENEWED RESISTANCE AND IT IS THEREFORE ALREADY POSSIBLE THAT ALTHOUGH THE ASSAILANT STILL ADVANCES IN TENSIVELY THE POSITION OF THE DEFENCE IS EVERY DAY IMPROVING IN SHORT WE COME BACK TO THIS THAT AS A RULE THERE IS NO SECOND SPRING AFTER A HALT HAS ONCE BEEN NECESSARY THEORY THEREFORE ONLY REQUIRES THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS AN INTENTION OF DES TROYING THE ENEMY THERE MUST BE NO CES SATION IN THE ADVANCE OF THE ATTACK IF THE COMMANDER GIVES UP THIS OBJECT BE CAUSE IT IS ATTENDED WITH TOO GREAT A RISK HE DOES RIGHT TO STOP AND EXTEND HIS FORCA THEORY OIUY OBJECTS TO THIS WHEN HE DOES IT WITH A VIEW TO MORE READILY DEFEATING THE ENEMY WE ARE NOT SO FOOLISH AS TO MAINTAIN THAT NO INSTAIH E CAN BE FOUND OF STATES 84 ON WAR BOOK YIIL HAVING BEEN GRADUALLY REDUOED TO THE UT MOST EXTREMITY IN THE FIRST PLACE THE PRINCIPLE WE NOW MAINT IIN IS NO ABSOLUTE TRUTH TO WHICH AN EXCEPTION IS IMPOSSI BLE BUT ONE FOUNDED OMY ON THE ORDI NARY AND PROBABLE RESULT NEXT WE MUST MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN CASES IN WHICH THE DOWNFALL OF A STATE HAS BEEN EFFECTED BY A SLOW GRADUAL PROCESS AND THOSE IN WHICH THE EVENT WAS THE RESULT OF A FIRST CAMPAIGN WE ARE HERE ONLY TREATING OF THE LATTER CASE FOR IT IS ONLY IN SUCH THAT THERE IS THAT TENSION OF FORCES WHICH EITHER OVERCOMES THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF THE WEIGHT OR IS IN DANGER OF BEING OVERCOME BY IT IF IN THE FIRST YEAR WE GAIN A MODERATE ADVANTAGE TO WHICH IN THE FOLLOWING WE ADD ANOTHER AND THUS GRADUALLY ADVANCE TOWARDS OUR OBJECT THERE IS NOWHERE VERY IMMINENT DANGER BUT IT IS DISTRIBUTED OVER MANY POINTS EACH PAUSE BETWEEN ONE RE SULT AND ANOTHER GIVES THE ENEMY FRESH CHANCES THE EFFECTS OF THE FIRST RESULTS HAVE VERY LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THOSE WHICH FOLLOW OFTEN NONE OFTEN A NEGATIVE ONLY BECAUSE THE ENEMY RECOVERS HIMSELF OR IS PERHAPS EXCITED TO INCREASED RESISTANCE OR OBTAINS FOREIGN AID WHEREAS WHEN ALL IS DONE IN ONE MARCH THE SUCCESS OF YESTERDAY BRINGS ON WITH ITSELF THAT OF TO DAY ONE BRAND LIGHTS ITSELF FROM ANOTHER IF THERE ARE CAEES IN WHICH STATES HAVE BEEN OVER COME BY SUCCESSIVE BLOWS IN WHICH CONSEQUENTLY TIFM GENERALLY THE PATRON OF THE DEFENSIVE HAS PROVED ADVERSE HOW INFINITELY MORE NUMEROUS ARE THE IN STANCES IN WHICH THE DESIGNS OF THE AGGRESSOR HAVE BY THAT MEANS UTTERLY FAILED LET US ONLY THINK OF THE RESULT OF THE SEVEN YEARS WAR IN WHICH THE AUSTRIANS SOUGHT TO ATTAIN THEIR OBJECT SO COMFORTABLY CAUTIOUSLY AND PRUDENTLY THAT THEY COMPLETELY MISSED IT IN THIS VIEW THEREFORE WE CANNOT AT ALL JOIN IN THE OPINION THAT THE CARE WHICH BELONGS TO THE PREPARATION OF A THEATRE OF WAR AND THE IMPULSE WHICH URGES US ONWARDSF ARE ON A LEVEL IN IMPORTANCE AND THAT THE FORMER MUST TO A CERTAIN EX TENT BE A COUNTERPOISE TO THE LATTER BUT WE LOOK UPON ANY EVIL WHICH SPRINGS OUT OF THE

BAG MADE SPASMODIC EFFORT TO GET A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE WORLD THERE IS NOTHING S DEMORALISING TO ANY LANDSCAPE AS A PAPER BAG UNLESS I NO THE CALL TO ANNS IS ORANGE PEEL AND OF THAT WE HAD PLENTY BUT I LOVED THE GLOWING NOTE IT MADE AS IT WINKED FROM THE TRODDEN GRASS A SKY OF PURE COLD BLUE ARCHED BEHIND THE ROOF TOPS BLOTTED BY GOLD WHITE CLOUDS WITH TRAILS OF GREY CIR RUS DRAGGED ACROSS THEM IN PLACES LIKE RAGGED CURTAINS AND IN THE STRONG SUNSHINE THE BLOCKS OF DISTANT FLATS GLARED A DEEP TAWNY RED AS I SAT GAZING AT ALL THIS PETER CAME TOWARDS ME OVER THE WASTE GROUND CARRYING A STRING BAG BULBOUS WITH BLUE PAPERED PARCELS AND EXUBERANT WITH LETTUCE SITTING DOWN ON THE STEP BELOW ME WITHOUT A WORD HE TOOK OFF HIS CAP AND LET THE COOL WIND SIFT REFRESHINGLY THROUGH HIS HAIR THEN TURNING HIS HEAD SWIFTLY WITH ONE OF HIS HALF SHY MOVEMENTS THAT ALWAYS REMINDED ME OF A YOUNG ANIMAL HE RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD AGAINST MY HAND A PROCEEDING RESENTED BY THE COMPANY S KIT TEN WHICH WAS NESTLING IN MY LAP YOU RE A STUNNING PERSON TO COME BACK TO PRIN CESS HE SAID HOW DID YOU GET ON WITH THE SHOPPING OH ALL RIGHT I WAS QUITE IN THE FASHION ALL THE BEST PEOPLE ROUND HERE CARRY A STRING BAG I WONDER WHY STRING BAGS HAVE ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME SUCH LIMP THINGS WITH NO PROPER SELF RESPECT ALL THE DEAR LADIES THEIR SHOPPING DONE WERE SCURRYING HOME TO PREPARE FOR THE HUSBAND S RETURN FROM THE OFFICE WHAT IS 4 THE OFFICE PRINCESS THE HUSBANDS ALL GO THERE DAILY NOT MARK YOU TO AN OFFICE BUT THE OFFICE I IMAGINE IT SOME VAST HALL OF INDUSTRY LINED WITH DESKS A HUSBAND BENDING OVER EACH YES

OFFICE BUT THEN IN SUBURBIA THEY ARE EXCLUSIVE I EXPECT THEY KEEP A SPECIAL PROVI DENCE WHATEVER THAT MAY BE THE SUBURBS ARE THE HOME OF MYSTERY NOT WHAT THEY SEEM FOR INSTANCE I BELIEVE IT INCORRECT

MAKING A HEAP THE CALL TO ARMS OF STICKY GREEN SHAVINGS THE SMELL OF BURNING PAINT BEING RATHER POWERFUL I DEPARTED WITH MY POTATOES TO COOK THE DINNER FOR THE BRUNETTE PETER BERT MIRRIT AND MYSELF WE BEING THE ONLY CARAVAN DWELLERS BESIDES THE HAGGETTS WHO FARED MORE SUMPTUOUSLY AND APART THAT AFTERNOON IT BEING EARLY CLOSING DAY FOR THE SHOPS WE WERE GIVING A MATINEE PERFORMANCE OF THE BELLS OF CHIMEHURST WHICH WAS DESCRIBED ON THE BILLS AS A RUSTIC COMEDY PETER WHYMPERIS WAS GENERALLY JEUNE PREMIER BUT IN THE BELLS OF CHIMEHURST HE WAS CAST FOR THE VILLAIN WE NEVER WERE ABLE TO UNDER STAND THE PLOT OF THE RUSTIC COMEDY OURSELVES THE CHURCH BELLS BURST INTO A PEAL WHENEVER ANYTHING OF PAR TICULAR INTEREST OCCURRED IN THE LIFE OF THE HEROINE WHICH SEEMS A SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL ARRANGEMENT HAGGETT HIM SELF IN A CHECK SUIT A TOP HAT AND A FAWN ULSTER PLAYED THE BLUFF OLD ENGLISH SQUIRE WHILST POOR PETER WAS DOOMED TO PROPOSE TO ME IN TARTAN TROUSERS AND HIS SHIRT SLEEVES TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF A MERRY PEAL FROM THE OBLIGING BELLS OF CHIMEHURST COMIC RELIEF WAS PROVIDED BY THE PART OF THE VILLAGE WASHERWOMAN PLAYED BY THE BLONDE THE OLD ENGLISH SQUIRE HAD A FLIRTATION WITH THIS LADY OVER HER WASH TUB AND HUMOUR OF AN EXCEED INGLY ELEMENTARY SORT WAS OBTAINED BY THE SHAKING OUT IN HIS FACE OF VARIOUS GARMENTS NOT USUALLY DISPLAYED IN POLITE SOCIETY IT WAS ALL VERY VULGAR VERY SILLY AND ESSENTIALLY MORAL VIRTUE IN THE PERSON OF THE ELOCU TIONIST RETURNED FROM AMERICA IN A DINNER JACKET AND A HOMBURG HAT TRIUMPHED COMPLETELY AND VILLAINY IN THE PERSON OF PETER COMMITTED SUICIDE PLAID TROUSERS AND ALL TO THE LAST BRIGHT PEAL OF THOSE OFFICIOUS BELLS ANY SUBTLETY OF INTERPRETATION WOULD HAVE BEEN WASTED ON PLAYS AND AUDIENCES BUT THERE WAS NOT EVEN GOOD THE MILKY WAY CLOAK AND DAGGER ACTING THE WOMEN FRUMPED ABOUT THE STAGE IN SKIRTS THAT SAGGED AT THE BACK TALKING IN A SUSTAINED SQUEAK AND THE MEN WERE EVEN MORE HOPELESS IT HAD BEEN AMUSING ENOUGH WHEN I FIRST

EXCELLENT MAN ON THE HILLS AND HE TOLD ME THAT A MONTH PREVIOUSLY HE HAD FOLLOWED SOME SHEEP BACK FURTHER THAN ANYONE HAD BEEN AND FOUND A LARGE LAKE DOUBTING HIS STORY SOMEWHAT I WENT WITH HIM NEXT DAY TO A PLACE WHERE WE COULD SEE NOT ONLY THE LAKE WHICH DID EXIST AFTER ALL BUT ALSO AN EXTENSIVE PANO RAMA OF THE RANGES WHILE DAN WENT DOWN TO THE WATER AND BACK TO OUR BIVOUAC BY ANOTHER ROUTE I SPENT MY TIME IN COM PLETING THE OBSERVATIONS C FROM THIS POINT E A VIEW OF ALL THREE BRANCHES COULD BE OBTAINED AND AN ACCURATE IDEA FORMED OF THE SIZE AND DIRECTION OF THE VAST ANCIENT GLACIERS WHICH EVIDENTLY FILLED THESE VALLEYS THE COUNTRY APPEARED MORE WEIRD THAN IT DID WHEN WE WERE UP THE RIVER THE GIGANTIC ROCK PRECIPICES AND SMOOTH SLOPES SHOWED TO ADVANTAGE AND THE VERY NARROW RIDGES IN EVIDENCE EVERY WHERE PROVED HOW HARD AND SOLID THE ROCK WAS THE PECULIAR CONFORMATION OF THIS DISTRICT WAS ALSO PLAINLY VISIBLE BUT IT WAS NO EASIER TO ACCOUNT FOR THAN WHEN UP THE VALLEY EVERY DIVERGENT RANGE AND EVERY SPUR ON SUCH RANGES IN THIS DISTRICT HAVE A SLOPING SIDE AND A PRECIPITOUS SIDE THUS IN ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE KARANGARUA THIS IS MOST EVIDENT FOR INSTANCE ON THE RANGE BETWEEN THE TWAIN AND MAIN BRANCH I WAS ABLE ON THE KARANGARUA SIDE TO WALK UP A BARE SLOPE OF 256 PIONEER WORK IN THE ALPS OF NEW ZEALAND SMOOTLI ROCK ONLY INTERRUPTED IN PLACES BY A BLNFE OR LOW CLIFF RUNNING ACROSS OR DOWN IT BUT THE VAST PRECIPICES ON TBE TWAIN SIDE NOT ONLY APPEAR TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SCALE BUT ARE EQUALLY HARD TO DESCRIBE AGAIN IN THE TWAIN WE HAYE THE SLOPE OF THE DOUGLAS NEIS TO THE SUMMIT OF THE RANGE ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE BUT IN THE COPLAND YALLEY THE SAME RANGE DROPS IN ENORMOUS CLIFIS ON TO WELCOME FLATS BETWEEN THE COPLAND RIVER AND COOK S WE FIND ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE COPLAND RANGE COMPARATIVELY LONG SPURS BUT ON THE NORTHERII ARE THE INACCESSIBLE CLIFFS OF COP LAND PEAK WHICH I ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE IN A FORMER CHAPTER TAKE ONE EXAMPLE OF THE SPURS OF THESE DIVERGENT RANGES NAMELY THE RIDGE BETWEEN REGINA CREEK AND TWAIN GORGE HERE WE FIND A SLOPE VARYING FROM 32 DEG TO 36 DEG AND IN A FEW PLACES A TRIFLE MORE ON THE TWAIN SIDE BUT REGINA CREEK IS WALLED IN ON THAT BANK BY STEEP PRECIPICES THE SLOPE ON THE KARANGARUA RANGE IS THE SAME AS THE DIP OF THE ROCK AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE GREAT PRECIPICES ARE DUE TO THE FRACTURE OF THE FORMATION UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY WELL GROUNDED IN GEOLOGY TO ATTEMPT A SOLUTION OR EXPLANATION OF THIS PECULIARITY THEREFORE HAVING DESCRIBED IT TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY I SHALL LEAVE IT FOR OTHERS TO EXPLAIN FOR STUDYING THE ACTION OF ANCIENT GLACIERS ON MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS THIS RIVER AND ITS BRANCHES GIVE AS GOOD OPPORTU NITIES AS ANY DISTRICT I KNOW FROM THE INFLOW OF THE COPLAND RIVER TO CASSELL S FLAT THE VALLEY IS ROUGHLY SPEAKING A MILE WIDE FILLED WITH GLACIAL DEPOSIT WHICH DESCENDS IN GENTLE SLOPES FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE HILLS TO THE CENTRE OF THE VALLEY THROUGH THIS MORAINIC DRIFT THE RIVER HAS CUT A CHANNEL LEAVING TERRACES ON EACH SIDE FROM 20 FT TO NEARLY 100 FT HIGH WHILE ITS KARANGAEUA DISTRICT 257 COURSE IS FULL OF LARGE ERRATIC BLOCKS IN SOME PLACES COMPLETELY BLOCKING THE VALLEY THE TOP OF THE TERRACE IS CHIEFLY FLAT FOR SOME CHAINS BACK CUT THROUGH HERE AND THERE BY DEEP CHANNELS AND GENERALLY COVERED WITH LARGE BOULDERS AT THE END OF TH9 SPUR OPPOSITE THE INFLOW OF THE COPLAND RIVER THA GLACIAL DRIF O IS PILED UP FOR SOME 100 FT WHILE THE SPUR ITSELF ABOVE AND BEHIND THE DRIFT SHOWS IN PLACES ICE SMOOTHED ROCK THE SLOPES OF MOUNT MCGLOIN AND OTHER MOUNTAINS INTO CASSELL S FLAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN A FORMER CHAPTER ABOVE THE FLAT THE VALLEY NARROWS TO BALF ITS ORIGINAL WIDTH AND THE WHOLE FLOOR RISES ABRUPTLY FOR one 200 FT THE ANCIENT ICE HAVING EVIDENTLY COME DOWN IN AN ICE FALL AT THIS POINT THE FACES OF THE ABRUPT STEP IN THE VALLEY ARE ROUNDED AND SMOOTH FORM ING WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED WHALE BACKS FROM THIS POINT TO THE SADDLE THE VALLEY HAS BEEN CUT OUT OF HARD GNEISS ROCK AND HAS HIGH BARE CLIFFS ON THE SOUTH AND SMOOTH ROCKY SLOPES ON THE LEFT WHILE THE FLOOR IS OF THE SAME ROCK AND SLOPES GENTLY DOWN ON THE SOUTH FROM THE FOOT OF THE PRECIPICES TO THE RIVER BROKEN HERE AND THERE BY TERRACES IN THE UPPER PORTION OF THE VALLEY FROM LAME DUCK FLAT TO THE SADDLE THE ROCK FLOOR HAS BEEN COVERED WITH MORAINIC DRIFT AS THE ANCIENT GLACIER RETREATED UP THE VALLEY AND DEBRIS FROM THE HILL SIDES IN PLACES THE WHOLE SURFACE OF SOIL AND BOULDERS HAS SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING NAKED ROCK SLOPES AT LAME DUCK FLAT THE RIVER RUNS ON A SMOOTB ROCKY BOTTOM AND FROM HERE TO THE BAR BELOW CASSELL S FLAT IT HAS EVIDENTLY MET WITH LESS OBSTRUCTION AND FLOWING OVER ROCK UNPROTECTED BY DEBRIS HAS GRADUALLY CUT THE FLOOR DOWN TO ITS PRESENT LEVEL AFTER LEAVING THIS FLAT THE RIVER DESCENDS GRADUALLY THROUGH THE DOVETAIL GORGE TO THE GREAT CATARACTS LEAVING BEHIND IT ON S 258 PIONEER WORK IN THE ALPS OF NEW ZEALAND THE LEFT A ROCK TERRACE WHICH GRADUALLY GROWS IN HEIGHT AS THE RIVER DESCENDS UNTIL AT THE CATARACT IT IS UPWARDS OF 300 FT HIGH FROM THE TOP OF THIS TERRACE THERE IS A GENTLE SLOPE FOR A FEW HUNDRED YARDS BACK OF SMOOTLI ROCK INTERRUPTED BY TWO OR THREE TERRACES TO THE FOOT OF THE GREAT SOLID PRECIPICES WHICH RISE FROM ONE TO TWO TBOUSAND FEET ABOVE THIS WAS EVIDENTLY THE OLD VALLEY BOTTOM ABRADED BY THE ICE"

HISTORY UNDER SUCCESSIVE KINGS ABOUT FIFTY DEER PARKS COULD BE NAMED WE MAY MENTION AS EXAMPLES THOSE AT LATHOM AND KNOWSLEY AT BLACKLEY FOR THE LORD OF MANCHESTER AT DALE PARK FOR THE ABBOT OF FURNESS AND SO ON THESE WOULD BE ENCLOSED WITH A PALE SIR GALAHAD WE REMEMBER RODE BY BRIDGE AND FORD BY PARK AND PALE LELAND SPEAKS OF EARL DERBY S PARK AT MYERSCOUGH AS PARTLY ENCLOSED WITH HEDGE PARTLY ALL ON THE MOOR SIDE WITH PALE THERE WERE ALSO ROYAL FORESTS AS FOR EXAMPLE AT BLEASDALE AT QUERN MORE NEAR LANCASTER AND AT TOXTETH LELAND MENTIONS THE KING S PARK AT TOXTETH THERE IS LITTLE SIGN OF DEER AT TOXTETH NOW IN ADDITION TO THESE THERE WERE PARKS IN THE HANDS OF PRIVATE INDI VIDUALS AND THESE ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ROYAL FORESTS BY BEING CALLED CHASES THE LORD OF MAN CHESTER FOR INSTANCE HAD HIS CHASE AT HORWICH THE ABBOT OF FURNESS HELD THE SPORTING RIGHTS OVER THE WHOLE OF HIS DOMAIN AND THERE WERE THE FOREST OF BOWLAND NORTH OF THE RIBBLE AND THE FOREST OF TOTTINGTON NEAR BURY NOW IN THE HONOUR OR ESTATE OF CLITHEROE WHICH WAS HELD BY THE LACY FAMILY THERE WERE THREE SUCH CHASES OR PRIVATE FORESTS 205 LANCASHIRE AND TO THIS DAY THEY ARE CALLED RESPECTIVELY THE FOREST OF ROSSENDALE THE FOREST OF TRAWDEN AND THE FOREST OF PENDLE LET US NOT FORGET THAT ALL THESE LANDS WERE GRANTED BY CHARLES II TO GENERAL MONK IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE ASSISTANCE HE GAVE HIM AT THE TIME OF THE RESTORATION THE GIFT INCLUDED ALSO ALL THE LAND IN FURNESS FROM MONK WHO BECAME DUKE OF ALBEMARLE THEY DESCENDED TO THE DUKE OF BUCCLEUCH WHO STILL HOLDS THEM IT IS WORTH NOTING ALSO HOW THE TERM LAUND OR PARK STILL LINGERS IN NORTH LANCASHIRE AS WELL AS THE NAME BOOTH THE BOOTHS WERE THE DWELLINGS OF THE HERDSMEN THEY FORMED THE NUCLEI OF THE COMING VILLAGES THUS IN PENDLE FOREST WE HAVE BARROW FORD BOOTH OLD LAUND BOOTH AND SO ON IN THESE FORESTS ALSO THE LORDS HAD THEIR VACCARIES OR CATTLE FARMS BUT THIS NAME HAS DIS APPEARED FROM THE MAPS VERY PICTURESQUE ARE THE DETAILS IN THE OLD SURVEYS AS TO THE DUTIES OF THE SUPER VISORS OF THESE FOREST LANDS AS REGARDED GAME AND THE BIRDS USED FOR FALCONRY AND THE DUTIES ALSO OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE AFFORESTED DISTRICTS TOWARDS THE FAUNA OF THE FOREST AND THE LORD S FORESTERS VERY HARDLY DID A NUMBER OF THE FOREST LAWS BEAR UPON THESE PEOPLE AND AT THE TIME OF THE SIGNING OF MAGNA CHARTA THE RELAXATION OF THE FOREST LAWS MEANT FAR MORE TO SOME OF KING JOHN S SUBJECTS THAN THE TWO OR THREE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES BY WHICH WE SET SO MUCH STORE AS THE KEYSTONE OF ENGLISH LIBERTIES AS AN INTERESTING ILLUSTRATION THERE IS STILL PRESERVED AT BROWSHOLME HALL IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE 206 PENDLE FOREST OF BOWLAND THE METAL STIRRUP OR LOOP THROUGH WHICH ACCORDING TO THESE LAWS IT MUST BE POSSIBLE TO PASS A DOG S FOOT BEFORE IT COULD BE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE FOREST IF THE FOOT WOULD NOT PASS THE GAUGE IT MUST HAVE THE TOES PARED OFF TILL IT COULD DO SO OR THE DOG WAS EXCLUDED ALTOGETHER"

MESSIAHSHIP AND MAKES THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THIS FACT HIS CHIEF MISSION JOHN one 6 8 19 34 YET IN OTHER CON NECTIONS HIS BEHEF IN THE MESSIAHSHIP OF JESUS IS QUITE DOUBT FUL MATT 11 2 6 LUKE 7 18 23 BUT APART FROM THESE ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE THE OFFICIAL RELATIONSHIP OF THESE TWO INDI VIDUALS TO ONE ANOTHER THE QUESTION OF MORE FUNDAMENTAL INTEREST IS WHAT JESUS PERSONAL REACTION TOWARD JOHN S MOVEMENT ACTUALLY WAS AND HOW FAR JESUS RECEIVED FROM JOHN VITAL STIMULUS FOR HIS OWN FUTURE WORK THIS IS THE POINT OF SPECIAL INTEREST FOR THE HISTORICAL STUDENT THE CONTINUATION OF THE JOHANNINE MOVEMENT SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE MOVEMENT INAUGURATED BY JESUS THOUGH ONLY INCIDENTALLY MENTIONED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT MARK 2 18 JOHN 3 22 4 one FF ACTS 18 25 19 35 F IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT ITEM FOR THE EARLY HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY THE TASK OF THE BIOGRAPHER IN EXAMINING JESUS OWN CAREER THE STUDENT IS CONFRONTED AT THE OUTSET BY THE FACT THAT JESUS OCCUPIES A TWOFOLD POSITION IN THE HISTORY OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY IN THE FIRST PLACE HE GATHERED ABOUT HIM A GROUP OF HEARERS TO WHOM HE IMPARTED INSTRUCTION REFLECTING HIS OWN PERSONAL RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND LIVING SECONDLY AFTER HIS DEATH HE CAME TO HOLD IN THE THINKING OF BELIEVERS A NEW POSITION AT GOD S RIGHT HAND IN HEAVEN HE NOW POS SESSED TRULY OFFICIAL DIGNITY AND WAS EXPECTED TO RETURN AT AN EARLY DATE TO SET UP THE MESSIANIC KINGDOM UPON EARTH THE 256 GUIDE TO STUDY OF CHRISTIAN RELIGION CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE EARTHLY JESUS OF PAST HISTORY AND THE HEAVENLY CHRIST OF PRESENT FAITH IS REFLECTED IN SUCH A STATEMENT AS ACTS 2 36 TO THE EFFECT THAT THROUGH THE RESURRECTION GOD HAD MADE THE CRUCIFIED JESUS TO BE BOTH LORD AND CHRIST MESSIAH ALTHOUGH THE JESUS OF HISTORY AND THE CHRIST OF FAITH WERE THUS ORIGINALLY DISTINGUISHED THE MEANING OF THIS DISTINCTION WAS SOON LOST AS BEHEVERS REFLECTED UPON THE EARTHLY CAREER OF JESUS IN THE KGHT OF THEIR NEW FOUND FAITH IN HIS HEAVENLY EXALTATION THEY WERE NOW ABLE TO SEE IN MANY OF HIS WORDS AND DEEDS A MUCH MORE ELEVATED SIGNIFICANCE THAN THEY HAD OBSERVED WHILE HE WAS WITH THEM THIS FAILURE TO APPRECIATE HIS FULL DIGNITY WHILE UPON EARTH WAS NOT CREDITED TO ANY LACK IN HIM BUT WAS QUITE THEIR OWN FAULT EITHER THEY HAD BEEN UNDULY STUPID OR ELSE FOR SOME GOOD REASON THEIR EYES FOR THE MOMENT HAD BEEN BLINDED BY THIS COURSE OF REASONING TTIEY WERE ABLE IN THE COURSE OF TIME TO DISCOVER IN THE EARTHLY HFE OF JESUS PRACTICALLY THE SAME OFFICIAL DIGNITY AND GLORY WHICH THEY NOW ATTACHED TO HIS PERSON IN HEAVEN THE TASK OF THE MODERN STUDENT OF THE HFE OF JESUS IS MADE ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT BY THIS SITUATION ALL THE DIRECT SOURCES OF INFORMATION AT PRESENT AVAILABLE DATE FROM A TIME WHEN THIS PROCESS OF REINTERPRETING THE LIFE OF JESUS HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR TWENTY YEARS OR MORE THE PROBLEM COULD BE EASILY SOLVED IF IT WERE SIMPLY A QUESTION OF REPRODUCING THIS OR THAT PICTURE OF JESUS AS SET FORTH BY ONE OR ANOTHER OF HIS EARLY INTERPRETERS BUT TODAY THE TASK OF THE HISTORIAN IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT SINCE HE MUST ENDEAVOR TO DETERMINE WHAT FEATURES IN THE SOURCES REPRESENT THE EARLY CHRISTIANS INTEREST IN THE HEAVENLY CHRIST AND WHAT DATA RELATE TO THE EARTHLY JESUS AS HE ACTUALLY APPEARED TO THE PEOPLE WHO ASSOC ATED WITH HIM DURING HIS PUBHC MINISTRY TO BE SURE THE BEHEVERS NEW APPRECIATION OF JESUS AFTER HIS DEATH IS AS MUCH OR MORE A PART OF THE HISTORY OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY AS IS THE THE STUDY OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY 257 STORY OF HIS EARTHLY CAREER BUT THE FORMER BELONGS IN THE HISTORY OF THE EARLY COMMUNITY SUBSEQUENT TO HIS DEATH AND NOT IN A STRICTLY HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY OF JESUS THE CHARACTER OF THE SOURCES IN VIEW OF THIS PECULIAR PROBLEM THE STUDENT OUGHT FIRST TO NOTE THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND THE VARIED PORTRAITS OF JESUS THERE PRESENTED PAUL S EPISTLES ARE THE OLDEST EXTANT CHRISTIAN DOCUMENTS BUT PAUL IS INTERESTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN CHRIST SPIRITUALLY PRESENT IN THE BEHEVER AND SOON TO COME UPON THE CLOUDS IN GLORY YET IT IS WORTHY OF NOTE THAT PAUL SHOWS HTTLE OR NO DISPOSITION TO SUPERIMPOSE THE OFFICIAL DIGNITY OF THE HEAVENLY CHRIST UPON THE EARTHLY JESUS WHILE IN PAUL S THINKING JESUS WAS A PRE EXISTENT DIVINE PERSONAHTY HIS CAREER UPON EARTH WAS ONE OF ALMOST ABNORMAL HUMIHTY AND LOWHNESS IN FACT THIS POINT IS ESPECIALLY STRESSED BY PAUL E G PHIL 2 5 FF BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR OUR PRESENT NEEDS PAUL HAS MENTIONED ONLY INCIDENTALLY A FEW ITEMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TEACHING AND ACTIVITY OF JESUS AT AN EARLY DATE PAUL HAD SEVERAL POINTS OF INTIMATE CONTACT WITH CHRISTIANS AND A CAREFUL READING OF HIS EPISTLES WITH A VIEW TO DISCOVERING INCIDENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT JESUS EARTHLY CAREER MAY BE EXPECTED TO YIELD SOME VALUABLE RESULTS E G GAL 3 13 4 4 I COR 11 23 FF 15 5 II COR 8 9 10 one ROM 7 one 15 3 PHIL 2 5 THE GOSPEL OF MARK SHOWS MUCH ADVANCE OVER PAUL S LETTERS IN ASSIGNING OFFICIAL DIGNITY TO THE EARTHLY JESUS THE AUTHOR OF THIS GOSPEL IS SUFFICIENTLY WELL INFORMED REGARDING THE ACTUAL HISTORY TO OBSERVE THAT THIS HEIGHTENED SIGNIFICANCE OF JESUS WAS NOT GENERALLY APPRECIATED PRIOR TO HIS DEATH BY EVEN HIS MOST INTIMATE ASSOCIATES E BUT MARK HIMSELF LABORS UNDER NO SUCH LIMITATIONS THE DISCIPLES HAD BEEN UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND CERTAIN WORDS AND DEEDS OF THE EARTHLY JESUS PREVIOUS TO HIS RESURRECTION CF 9 9 F BUT NOW HE HAS 258

VAIN DELUSION IN NINETY NINE CASES OUT OF A HUNDRED THIS SOLITARY PEDICULUS WOULD PROVE TO BE THE ADVANCE GUARD OF GENERATIONS YET TO COME WHICH ERE ITS CAPTURE HAD BEEN STEALTHILY ENGAGED IN SOWING ITS SEED AND IN A SPACE OF TIME ALL TOO BRIEF AFTER THE FIRST LIFE IN LOG HUTS 81 DISCOVERY THE SAME SOLDIER WOULD APPOINT HIMSELF AN INVES TIGATING COMMITTEE OF ONE TO SIT WITH CLOSED DOORS AND HIE AWAY TO THE DESIRED SECLUSION THERE HE WOULD SEAT HIMSELF TAKING HIS GARMENTS ACROSS HIS KNEES IN TURN CONSCIENTIOUSLY DOING HIS K NITTING WORK INSPECTING EVERY FIBRE WITH THE SCRUTINY OF A DEALER IN BROADCLOTHS THE FEELING OF INTENSE DISGUST AROUSED BY THE FIRST CONTACT WITH THESE CREEPERS SOON GAVE WAY TO HARDENED INDIFFERENCE AS A SOLDIER REALIZED THE UTTER IMPOSSI BILITY OF KEEPING FREE FROM THEM AND THE PRIVACY WITH WHICH HE CARRIED ON HIS FIRST SKIR MISHING AS THIS SEARCH FOR HAPPI NESS CAME TO BE CALLED WAS SOON ABANDONED AND THE WARFARE CARRIED ON MORE OPENLY IN FACT IT WAS THE MARK OF A CLEANLY SOLDIER TO BE SEEN ENGAGED AT IT FOR THERE WAS NO DISGUISING THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY NEEDED TO DO IT IN COOL WEATHER SKIRMISHING WAS CAR RIED ON IN QUARTERS BUT IN WARMER WEATHER THE MEN PRE FERRED TO GO OUTSIDE OF CAMP FOR THIS PURPOSE AND THE WOODS USUALLY FOUND NEAR CAMPS WERE FULL OF THEM SPRINKLED ABOUT SINGLY OR IN SOCIAL PARTIES OF TWO OR THREE SLAYING THEIR VIC TIMS BY THE THOUSANDS NOW AND THEN A MAN COULD BE SEEN JUST FROM THE QUARTERMASTER WITH AN ENTIRE NEW SUIT ON HIS ARM BENT ON STARTING AFRESH HE WOULD HANG THE SUIT ON A BUSH STRIP OFF EVERY PIECE OF THE OLD AND SET FIRE TO THE K NITTING WORK 82 HARD TACK AND COFFEE SAME AND THOU DON THE NEW SUIT OF BLUE SO FAR WELL BUT HE WAS A LUCKY MAN IF HE DID NOT SHARE HIS NEW CLOTHES WITH OTHER HUNGRY PEDICULI INSIDE OF A WEEK SKIRNUSHING HOWEVER FURNISHED ONLY SLIGHT RELIEF FROM THE OJ PRESSIVE ATTENTIONS OF THE GRAYBACK AND FURTHERMORE TOOK MUCH TIME HOT WATER WAS THE SOVEREIGN REMEDY FOR IT PENETRATED EVERY MESH AND SEAM AND COOKED THE MILLIONS YET UN BORN WHICLI JOB HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE EXTERMINATED BY THE THUMB NAIL PROCESS UNAIDED SO TENACIOUS OF LIFE WERE THESE CREATURES TLIAT SOME VETERANS AFHRM THEY HAVE SEEN THEM STILL CREE ING ON GAR MENTS TAKEN OUT OF BOILING IVATER AND THAT ONLY B PUTTING SALT IN THE WATER WERE THEY SURE OF AC COMPLISHING THEIR DESTRUCTION I THINK THERE WAS BUT ONE OPINION AMONG THE SOLDIERS IN REGARD TO THE GRAYBACKS VIZ THAT THE COUNTRY WAS BEING RUINED BY OVER PRODUC TION WHAT THE COLORADO BEETLE IS TO THE POTATO CROP THEY WERE TO THE SOLDIERS OF BOTH ARMIES AND THAT MAN HAS FAME AND FORTUNE IN HIS HAND WHO BEFORE THE NEXT GREAT WAR IN ANY COUNTRY SHALL HAVE INVENTED AN EXTIRPATOR WHICH SHALL DO FOR THE PEDIEULUS WHAT PARIS GREEN DOES FOR THE POTATO BUG FROM ALL THIS IT CAN READILY BE SEEN WHY NO GOOD SOLDIER WANTED HIS BUNK TO BE REGARDED AS COMMON PROPERTY I MAY ADD IN PASSING THAT NO OTHER VARIETY OF INSECT LIFE CAUSED ANY MATERIAL ANNOYANCE TO THE SOLDIER NOW AND THEN A WOOD TICK WOULD INSERT HIS HEAD ON THE SLY INTO SOME PART OF THE HUMAN INTEGUMENT BUT THESE WERE NOT COMMON OR UNCLEAN TUKNING ILIM UVEK LIFE IN LOG HUTS 83 I HAVE ALREADY RELATED MUCH THAT THE SOLDIER DID TO PASS AWAY TIME I WILL ADD TO THAT WHICH I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN TWO BRANCHES OF DOMESTIC INDUSTRY THAT OCCUPIED A CONSID ERABLE TIME IN LOG HUTS WITH A FEW AND LESS F VERY MUCH LESS INDEED WITH OTHERS I REFER TO WASHING AND MENDING SOME OF THE MEN WERE JUST AS PARTICULAR ABOUT CHANGING THEIR UNDER CLOTHING AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AS THEY WOULD BE AT HOME WHILE OTHERS WOULD DO SO ONLY UNDER THE SEVEREST PRESSURE IT IS DISGUSTING TO REMEM BER EVEN AT THIS LATE DAY HOW LITTLE CARE LUM DREDS OF THE MEN BE STOWED ON BODILY CLEAN LINESS THE STORY QUITE FAMILIAR TO OLD SOLDIERS ABOUT THE MAN WHO WAS SO NEGLIGENT IN THIS RESPECT THAT WHEN LIE FINALLY TOOK A BATH HE FOUND A NUMBER OF SHIRTS AND SOCKS WLIICH HE SUPPOSED HE HAD LOST AROSE FROM THE FACT OF THERE BEING A FEW MEN IN EVERY ORGANIZATION WHO WERE MOST UNACCOUNT Y ABLY REGARDLESS OF ALL RULES OF HEALTH AND OF WHOM SUCH A STATEMENT WOULD SEEM TO I THOSE THAT KNEW TLIE PARTIES ONLY SLIGHTLY EXAGGERATED A WOOD TICK P HOW WAS THIS WASHING DONE R WEIL IT THE TROOPS WERE CAMPING NEAR A BROOK THAT SIMPLIFIED THE MATTER SOMEWHAT BUT EVEN THEN THE CLOTHES MUST BE BOILED AND FOR THIS PURPOSE THERE WAS BUT ONE RESOURCE THE MESS KETTLES THERE IS A FAMILIAR ANECDOTE RELATED OF DANIEL 150ILINO THKM 84 HARD TACK AND COFFEE WEBSTER THAT WHILE HE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE THE FRENCH MINISTER AT WASHINGTON ASKED HIM WHETHER THE UNITED STATES WOULD RECOGNIZE THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE I THINK LOUIS NAPOLEON S ASSUMING A VERY SOLEMN TONE AND POSTURE WEBSTER REPLIED WHY NOT THE UNITED STATES LIAS RECOGNIZED THE BOURBONS THE FRENCH REPUBLIC THE DIRECTORY THE COUNCIL OF FIVE HUNDRED THE FIRST CONSUL THE EMPER OR LOUIS XVII L CHARLES X LOUIS PHILIPPE THE ENOUGH ENOUGH I CRIED THE MINISTER FULLY SATISFIED WITH THE EXTENDED ARRAY OF PRECEDENTS CITED SO IN REGARD TO USING OUR MESS KET TLES TO BOIL CLOTHES IN IT MIGHT BE ASK ED WHY NOT WERE THEY NOT USED TO BOIL OUR MEAT AND POTATOES IN TO MAKE OUR BEAN PEA AND MEAT SOUPS IN TO BOIL OUR TEA AND COFFEE IN TO MAKE OUR APPLE AND PEACH SAUCE IN WHY NOT USE THEM AS WASH BOILERS WELL GENTLE READER WHILE IT MIGHT AT FIRST INTERFERE SOME WHAT WITH YOUR APPETITE TO HAVE 3M3UR FOOD COOKED IN THE WASH BOILER YOU WOULD SOON GET USED TO IT AND SO THIS COM PLEX USE OF THE MESS KETTLES SOON CEASED TO AFFECT THE APPETITE OR TO SHOCK THE SENSE OF PROPRIETY OF THE AVERAGE SOLDIER AS TO THE ETERNAL FITNESS OF THINGS FOR HE WAS OFTEN COMPELLED B CIRCUMSTANCES TO ENDURE MUCH GREATER IMPROPRIETIES IT CLEANING UP LIFE IN LOG HUTS 85 WOULD INDEED HAVE BEEN A MOST ADMIRABLE ARRANGEMENT IN MANY RESPECTS COULD EACH MAN HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH AN EXCELLENT MAGEE RANGE WITH COPPER BOILER ANNEX AND SET TUBS NEAR BY BUT THE LINE HAD TO BE DRAWN SOMEWHERE AND SO EVERYTHING IN THE LINE OF IMPEDIMENTA WAS DONE AWAY WITH UNLESS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE SERVICE FOR THIS REASON WE COULD NOT TAKE ALONG A WELL EQUIPPED LAUNDRY BUT MUST MAKE SOME ARTICLES DO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE SERVICE IT MAY BE ASKED WHAT KIND OF A FIGURE THE MEN CUT AS AVASHERWOMEN WELL SOME OF THEM WERE AWKWARD AND IMPERFECT ENOUGH AT IT BUT NECESSITY IS A CAPITAL TEACHER AND IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER DIRECTIONS MEN DID PERFORCE WHAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ATTEMPTED AT HOME IT WAS NOT NECESSARY HOWEVER FOR EVERY MAN TO DO HIS OWN WASHING FOR IN MOST COMPANIES THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE MAN WHO FOR A REASONABLE RECOMPENSE WAS READY TO DO SUCH WORK AND HE USUALLY FOUND ALL HE COULD ATTEND TO IN THE TIME HE HAD OFF DUTY THERE WAS NO IRONING TO BE DONE F JR L OILED SHIRTS AS WHITE BOSOMED SHIRTS WERE CALLED WERE ALMOST AN UN KNOWN GARMENT IN THE ARMY EXCEPT IN LIOS ITALS FLANNELS WERE THE ORDER OF THE DAY IF A MAN HAD THE COURAGE TO FACE THE RIDICULE OF HIS COMRADES BY WEARING A WHITE COLLAR IT WAS OF THE PAPER VARIETY AND WHITE CUFFS WERE UNKNOWN IN CAMP IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MENDING GARMENTS EACH MAN DID HIS OWN WORK OR LEFT IT UNDONE JUST AS HE THOUGHT BEST BUT NO ONE HIRED IT DONE EVERY MAN HAD A HOUSEWIFE OR ITS EQUIVALENT CONTAINING THE NECESSARY NEEDLES YARN THIMBLE ETC FURNISHED HIM BY SOME MOTHER SISTER SWEETHEART OR SOLDIER S AID SOCIETY AND FROM THIS CAME HIS MATERIALS TO MEND OR DARN WITH NOW THE AVERAGE SOLDIER WAS NOT SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE CHARMS AND ALLUREMENTS OF SOCK DARNING AS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR THIS REASON HE ALWAYS PUT OFF THE DIREFUL DAY UNTIL BOTH HEELS LOOKED BOLDLY AND WITH HARDENED VISAGE OUT THE BACK DOOR WHILE HIS TEN TOES RANGED THEMSELVES EN ECHELOTI IN 80 HARD TACK AND COFFEE FRONT OF THEIR QUARTERS L Y SUCH DELAY OR NEGLECT GOOD VENTILATION AND THE O ORTUNITY OF DRAWING ON THE SOCKS FROM EITHER END WERE SECURED"

TIMBERS AND THE DIMINUTIVE HACKMATACK KNEES FROM THE SWAMP FAR BACK IN THE EQUILLE VALLEY AND WHENEVER THE SLEDDING WAS GOOD WITH HIS YOKE OF BLACK OXEN HE HAD HAULED HIS MATERIALS TO THE SECRET PLACE OF HIS SHIPBUILDING BY THE WINDING SHORE OF A DEEP TIDAL TRIBUTARY OF THE PORT ROYAL IN THE SPRING HE HAD LAID THE KEEL AND RIVETED SECURELY TO IT THE SQUARED HACKMATACK KNEES IT WAS UNUSUAL TO USE SUCH STURDY AND UNMANAGEABLE TIMBERS AS THESE HACKMATACK KNEES FOR A CRAFT SO SMALL AS THIS WHICH THE YOUNG ACADIAN WAS BUILDING BUT JEAN MICHAUD S THOUGHTS WERE LONG THOUGHTS AND WENT FAR AHEAD HE WAS PUTTING ALL HIS HOPES AS WELL AS ALL HIS SCANT PATRIMONY INTO THIS LITTLE SHIP AND HE WAS RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD BE STRONG TO CARRY HIS FORTUNES THROUGH ALL THE GREEN AND BLUE AND GOLDEN ACADIAN SUMMER HE HAD TOILED JOYOUSLY AT BENDING THE THIN PLANKS AND RIVETING THEM SOUNDLY TO THE RIBS THE STEM AND THE STERNPOST IT WAS HOT WORK BUT WHITE AND SAVORY THE CLEAN SPRUCE PLANKS THAT HE WROUGHT WITH BREATHING SWEET SCENTS TO HIS LUNGS AS ADZE AND CHISEL AND SAW SET FREE THE TONIC SPIRIT OF THEIR FIBRES HIS CHIPS SOON SPREAD A YELLOW CARPET OVER THE MOSSY SWARD AND THE TREE ROOTS THE YELLOW SIDES OF HIS GRACEFUL CRAFT PRESENTLY AROSE HIGH AMONG THE GREEN KISSING BRANCHES OF THE WATER ASH AND INDIAN PEAR THE TAWNY GOLDEN SHIMMERING CURRENT OF THE CREEK LIPPED UP AT HIGH TIDE CLOSE UNDER THE STERN OF THE LITTLE SHIP AND SET AFLOAT THE LOWEST LAYERS OF THE CHIPS WHILE AT EBB A GLEAMING ABYSS OF RED MUD WITH WALLS SLOPING SHARPLY TO A MERE RIVULET AT THEIR FOOT SEEMED TO TEMPT THE STRUCTURE TO A PREMATURE LAUNCHING AND A WILD SWOOPING RUSH TO OOZY DOOM VERY SECLUDED FAR APART FROM BEATEN HIGHWAY OR FOREST BYWAY AND QUITE ASIDE FROM ALL THE RIVER TRAFFIC WAS THE PLACE OF JEAN MICHAUD S SHIPBUILDING AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT THE CLEAR RINGING BLOWS OF HIS ADZE THE SHARP STACCATO OF HIS DILIGENT HAMMER AND THE STRIDENT CRYING OF HIS SAW BROUGHT NO ANSWER BUT THE CHATTER OF THE STRIPED CHIPMUNKS AMONG THE NEAR TREE ROOTS OR THE SCOLDING OF THE GARRULOUS AND INQUISITIVE RED SQUIRRELS FROM THE BRANCHES OVERHEAD AT THE QUIET OF THE NOON HOUR WHILE JEAN LAY IN THE SHADE CONTEMPLATING HIS HANDIWORK AND WEAVING HIS MANY COLORED DREAMS AND MUNCHING HIS BROWN BREAD CAKES AND PALE CHEESE THE CLUCKING PARTRIDGE HEN WOULD LEAD HER BROOD OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE EDGES OF THE CHIP STREWN OPEN WHERE INSECTS GATHERED IN THE HEAT AND AFTERWARD WHEN ONCE MORE JEAN S HAMMERING SET UP ITS BRISK AND CHEERFUL ECHOES THE BIG GOLDEN WING WOODPECKERS WOULD PROMPTLY ACCEPT THE SOUND AS A CHALLENGE AND BEGIN AN EMULOUS RAT TAT TAT TAT TING ON THE RESONANT SOUND BOARD OF A DEAD BEECH NOT FAR OFF BY THE TIME THE PARTRIDGE BROOD HAD TAKEN TO WHIRRING UP INTO THE MAPLE BRANCHES WHEN ALARMED INSTEAD OF SCURRYING TO COVER IN THE UNDERBRUSH THE HULL WAS COMPLETED AND A SMELL OF SMOKING PITCH DROWNED THE WOODSY ODORS AS JEAN CALKED THE SEAMS THEN THE PALE YELLOW OF THE TIMBERS NO MORE SHONE THROUGH THE REDDENING LEAFAGE BUT A SOMBRE BLACK BULK LOOMED IMPRESSIVELY ABOVE THE CHIPS DAUNTING THE SQUIRRELS FOR A FEW DAYS WITH ITS STRANGE SHADOW BY THE TIME OF THE MOOSE CALLING WHEN THE ROWAN BERRIES HUNG IN GREAT SCARLET BUNCHES AND HALF THE RED LEAFAGE WAS TURNING BROWN AND THE PALE GOLD BIRCH LEAVES FELL IN FLUTTERING SHOWERS AT EVERY GUST TWO SLIM MASTS HAD RAISED THEIR TOPS ABOVE THE TREES AND A WHITE BOWSPRIT WAS THRUSTING ITS NOSE INTO THE BRANCHES OF THE NEAREST RED MAPLE UNDER THE BOWSPRIT GLITTERED A CARVED AND GILDED MADONNA THE MOST AUSPICIOUS FIGUREHEAD TO WHICH IN JEAN S EYES HE COULD INTRUST THE FORTUNES OF HIS HANDIWORK A FEW DAYS MORE AND THE SHIP WAS DONE SO NEARLY COMPLETE THAT THREE OR FOUR HOURS OF WORK WOULD MAKE HER READY FOR SEA BEING SO SMALL IT WAS FEASIBLE TO LAUNCH HER IN THIS ADVANCED STATE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BUILT MADE IT NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO HURRY STRAIGHT FROM THE GREASED WAYS OF THE LAUNCHING TO THE SECURITY OF THE OPEN SEA THE TIDAL CREEK IN WHICH SHE WOULD FIRST TAKE WATER COULD GIVE HER NO SAFE HARBORAGE AND ONCE OUT OF THE CREEK SHE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE ALL SPEED UNDER COVER OF NIGHT TILL PORT ROYAL RIVER AND THE SODDED RAMPARTS OF ANNAPOLIS TOWN SHOULD BE LEFT MANY MILES ASTERN HAVING MADE HIS PREPARATIONS AND GATHERED HIS MATERIALS FAR AHEAD AND DEVISED HIS PRECAUTIONS WITH SUBTLETY AND ACCUSTOMED HIS NEIGHBORS TO THE IDEA THAT HE WAS AN ERRATIC YOUTH GIVEN TO LONG ABSENCES AND FUTILE SCHEMES NOT WORTH GOSSIP JEAN HAD SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING HIS ENTERPRISE A SECRET FROM ALL BUT TWO PERSONS THESE TWO DEEP IN HIS COUNSEL S FROM THE FIRST WERE BARBE DIEUDONN HIS SWEETHEART AND MICH MASSON HIS FRIEND AND ALLY MICH MASSON WHOSE HOME WHICH SERVED HIM BEST AS A PLACE TO STAY AWAY FROM WAS IN THE VILLAGE OF GRAND PR FAR UP ON THE BASIN OF MINAS HAD BEEN JEAN S CLOSE FRIEND SINCE EARLY BOYHOOD IN THE DAYS BEFORE PORT ROYAL TOWN HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY THE ENGLISH AND FOUND ITS NAME CHANGED TO ANNAPOLIS HE WAS A DARING ADVENTURER HUNTER WOODS RANGER AN IMPLACABLE PARTISAN OF THE FRENCH CAUSE AND JUST NOW DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE TRAFFIC BETWEEN ACADIE AND THE NEW FRENCH FORTRESS CITY OF LOUISBURG A TRAFFIC WHICH THE ENGLISH GOVERNOR WAS ANGRILY DETERMINED TO BREAK UP MICH MASSON COULD SAIL A SHIP AS WELL AS SET A DEAD FALL OR LAY AN AMBUSH HE HAD KEPT BRIGHT IN JEAN S HEART THE FLAME OF HATRED AGAINST THE ENGLISH CONQUERORS OF ACADIE IT WAS HE WHO HAD COME TO THE AID OF JEAN S SHIPBUILDING FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN TIMBERS HAD TO BE PUT IN PLACE WHICH WERE TOO HEAVY FOR ONE PAIR OF HANDS TO WORK WITH IT WAS INDEED AT HIS SUGGESTION THAT JEAN HAD FINALLY DECIDED TO SELL HIS COTTAGE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ANNAPOLIS TOWN HIS SCRAP OF UPLAND WITH ITS APPLE TREES IN FULL BEARING HIS STRIP OF RICH DIKE LAND WITH ITS APPLE TREES IN FULL BEARING HIS STRIP OF RICH DIKE FORBIDDEN TRAFFIC AND TO SETTLE UNDER THE WALLS OF LOUISBURG WHERE THE FLAG HE LOVED SHOULD ALWAYS WAVE OVER HIS ROOF TREE IT WAS MICH MASSON WHO HAD SHOWN JEAN HOW BY THIS COURSE HE COULD QUICKLY GROW RICH AND MAKE A HOME FOR BARBE WHICH THAT SOMEWHAT DISCONCERTING AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE MAIDEN WOULD NOT SCORN TO ACCEPT MICH MASSON LOVED HIS OWN HONOR HE LOVED JEAN HE HATED THE ENGLISH JEAN S SECRET WAS SAFE WITH HIM MADEMOISELLE BARBE UNDER A DISGUISE OF INDIFFERENCE WHICH SOMETIMES REDUCED JEAN TO THE NOT UNPROFITABLE CONDITION WHEREIN HARD WORK IS THE SOLE REFUGE FROM DESPAIR HID A PASSIONATE INTEREST IN HER LOVER S UNDERTAKING SHE TOO HATED THE NEW DOMINATION"

THE DRAINAGE FROM THE THREE BUILDINGS FURNISHED THE FRESH WATER SUPPLY OF THE SET TLEMENT IF THE SHOWERS WERE LIGHT THE OVERFLOW FROM THE LARGESS OF THE RIVAL CHURCHES PLASHING ON THE SHEETS OF CORRUGATED IRON FILLED THE HOUSE WITH A MONOTONOUS MURMUR LIKE THE DROWSY ARGUMENT OF TWO SOFT VOICED MISSIONARIES BUT DURING A HEAVY DOWNPOUR THE SENSES WERE STUNNED BY THE INCESSANT THUNDER AS THOUGH ONE WERE INCLOSED IN AN IMMENSE DRUM BEATEN WITH NONSECTARIAN VIGOR BY ALL THE SALVATION ARMIES IN THE WORLD IT WAS DURING SUCH A DELUGE ONE DAY IN EARLY SPRING THAT I LAY ON THE GUEST BED IN PUAREI S ONE ROOM HOUSE 132 A DEBTOR OF MOY LING WATCHING POURA HIS WIFE WHO HAD WASHED MY LINEN WITH HER OWN HANDS AND WAS THEN IRONING IT IT WAS NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING LINEN THE ARTICLES WERE THREE A SLEEVELESS GUAZE SINGLET A COTTON HANDKERCHIEF AND A FADED KHAKI SHIRT A PAIR OF KHAKI TROUSERS A PAIR OF CANVAS TENNIS SHOES AND A PANDANUS HAT COMPLETED MY WARDROBE SINCE I NEEDED THE WHOLE OF IT WHEN GOING ABROAD ABOUT THE ISLAND IT WAS NECESSARY TO GO TO BED ON WASHING DAY AND TO WAIT THERE UNTIL THE LAUNDERING WAS FINISHED AND SUCH REPAIRS MADE AS CONSTANT WEAR HAD CAUSED AND FURTHER WEAR DEMANDED HOW TO REPLENISH IT AND TO MEET OTHER SIMPLE URGENT NEEDS GAVE ME CAUSE FOR SOME CONCERN AND I WAS GOING OVER THE PROBLEM AS I LAY ON PUAREI S GUEST BED IT WAS TOWARD THE END OF MY SECOND WEEK AT RUTIARO AND ALREADY I WAS BEGINNING TO LOOK DECIDEDLY SHABBY MY SHOES WERE ROTTED OUT WITH SEA WATER AND BOTH SHIRT AND TROUSERS WHICH WERE FAR FROM NEW AT THE TIME OF MY ARRIVAL GAVE EVIDENCE OF EARLY DISSOLUTION POURA HAD WASHED SEWED ON BUTTONS DRAWN SEAMS TOGETHER BUT THE GARMENTS WERE CHRONICALLY AILING AS HOPELESS OF EFFECTIVE REPAIR AS AN OLD MAN FAR GONE IN SENILE DECAY POURA WAS BECOMING DISCOURAGED ABOUT THEM AND I KNEW THAT SHE MUST BE WONDERING WHY I DIDN T BUY SOME FRESH ONES I HAD A VERY GOOD REASON FOR NOT DOING SO I HAD NO MONEY I HAD BEEN LEFT AT RUTIARO WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A TWENTY FIVE CENTIME PIECE AND THE BANQUE DE LTNDO CHINE WAS SIX HUNDRED MILES AWAY IT WOULD NOT OCCUR TO EITHER PUAREI OR HIS WIFE THAT I WAS IN NEED OF FUNDS THEIRS WAS ONE OF THE MORE PRIMITIVE ATOLLS OF THE LOW ARCHIPELAGO WHERE ALL WHITE MEN ARE REGARDED AS MYSTERIOUSLY AFFLUENT IF INSTEAD OF BEING MAROONED AT RUTIARO THROUGH TINO S FIT OF 10 133 FAERY LANDS OF THE SOUTH SEAS TEMPER I HAD BEEN DISCOVERED A MILE OUTSIDE THE REEF MAKING TOWARD THE LAND CLAD ONLY IN A PAIR OF SWIM MING TRUNKS UPON REACHING IT MY RESCUERS WOULD HAVE EXPECTED ME AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO TAKE A BULKY PARCEL OF THOUSAND FRANC NOTES FROM BENEATH THAT GARMENT I HAD IN FACT MADE A SECRET INVENTORY OF MY WEALTH AFTER THE SUDDEN DEPARTURE OF THE CALEB WINSHIP HOPING THERE MIGHT BE A FORGOTTEN BANK NOTE IN ONE OF MY TROUSERS POCKETS WHAT I FOUND WAS A COTTON HANDKERCHIEF A PICTURE POST CARD OF THE WOOL WORTH BUILDING AND A SMALL MUSICAL INSTRUMENT CALLED AN OCHARINA OR MORE COMMONLY A SWEET POTATO WHISTLE THE HANDKERCHIEF I NEEDED THE POST CARD SEEMED OF NO PRACTICAL USE AS A MEANS OF BARTER AND WHILE I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN UP THE OCHARINA IT HAD BUT A SLIGHT MONETARY VALUE AND MOY LING THE CHINESE STOREKEEPER OF THE VILLAGE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN IT I DIDN T OFFER IT TO HIM OUTRIGHT INSTEAD I PLAYED ON IT IN FRONT OF HIS SHOP THE MARCH OF THE BLACK WATCH WHICH I COULD RENDER WITH SOME SKILL THEREAFTER EVERY YOUNGSTER ON THE ISLAND COVETED THE INSTRUMENT BUT MOY LING MADE NO OFFERS AND THE PROSPECT OF A WARDROBE WAS AS FAR AWAY AS EVER HIS SUPPLY OF EUROPEAN CLOTHING WAS LIMITED BUT AMPLE TO SUPPLY MY WANTS HE FOUND FOR ME THREE UNDERSHIRTS SIZE FORTY FOUR TWO GINGHAM OUTER SHIRTS OF LESS AMPLE PROPORTIONS A PAIR OF DUNGAREE OVERALLS AND A PAIR OF ROPE SOLE SHOES I ASKED HIM TO PUT THESE ARTICLES ASIDE AND WENT OFF TO REFLECT UPON WAYS AND MEANS OF OPENING A CREDIT ACCOUNT WITH THE CANNY CHINAMAN THERE WAS ONE POSSIBLE METHOD OPEN TO ME I MIGHT ADOPT THE PAREU AS A COSTUME I COULD BUY THREE OF THEM FOR THE PRICE OF ONE UNDERSHIRT AND 134 A DEBTOR OF MOY LING I BELIEVED THAT MOY LING WOULD TRUST ME TO THAT EXTENT NEARLY ALL OF THE NATIVES WORE PAREUS THEY HAD PUT ASIDE THEIR TROUSERS AND SHIRTS AND GINGHAM DRESSES NOW THAT I WAS NO LONGER A STRANGER TO THEM AND WERE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IN THEIR SIMPLE KNEE LENGTH GARMENTS THOSE OF THE MEN REACHING FROM THE WAIST THOSE OF THE WOMEN TWISTED TIGHTLY UNDER THE ARMS SIMPLE AND CONVENIENT THOUGH IT WAS I FELT THAT IT WOULD BE ABSURD FOR ME TO ASSUME THAT STYLE OF DRESS SINCE I WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO IT FURTHER MORE I REMEMBERED THE RIDICULOUS APPEARANCE OF AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS I HAD SEEN AT TAHITI QUEER PEOPLE FROM ALL SORTS OF QUEER PLACES WHO COME AND GO THROUGH THE CAPITAL OF FRENCH OCEANIA THEY RUSHED INTO PARENS THE MOMENT OF THEIR ARRIVAL AT PAPEETE AND BEFORE A WEEK HAD PASSED WERE MORE PRIMITIVE IN A SOPHISTICATED WAY THAN THE TAHITIANS THEMSELVES I HAD NO DESIRE TO JOIN THE RANKS OF THE AMATEUR CANNIBALS EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS SOME EXCUSE FOR IT AT RUTIARO AND I KNEW THAT THE PAUMOTUANS WOULD HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR ME IF I DRESSED AFTER THE MANNER OF MY OWN RACE BUT HOW OBTAIN CLOTHING WITHOUT MONEY WITHOUT DIVULGING TO ANYONE THAT I HAD NO MONEY THE QUESTION DINNED THROUGH MY BRAIN WITH ANNOYING PERSISTENCE LIKE THE THUNDER OF FALLING WATER ON PUAREI S IRON ROOF WOULD IT AFTER ALL BE BEST TO CONFIDE IN THE CHIEF I COULD TELL HIM OF MY BANK ACCOUNT AT PAPEETE AND HE KNEW OF COURSE THAT THE CALEB WINSHIP HAD LEFT ME WITHOUT A WORD OF WARNING TAKING MY SEA CHEST WITH HER"
